### Zephaniah 3

1 WOE to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! ^1

2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the $L{\small ORD}$; she drew not near to her God. ^2

3 Her princes within her _are_ roaring lions; her judges _are_ evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. ^3

4 Her prophets _are_ light _and_ treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. ^4

5 The just $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. ^5

6 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. ^6

7 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, _and_ corrupted all their doings. ^7

8 ¶ Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination _is_ to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, _even_ all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. ^8

9 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, to serve him with one consent. ^9

10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, _even_ the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. ^10

11 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. ^11

12 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12

13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make _them_ afraid. ^13

14 ¶ Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. ^14

15 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, _even_ the $L{\small ORD}$, _is_ in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. ^15

16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: _and_ _to_ Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. ^16

17 The $L{\small ORD}$ thy God in the midst of thee _is_ mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. ^17

18 I will gather _them_ _that_ _are_ sorrowful for the solemn assembly, _who_ are of thee, _to_ _whom_ the reproach of it _was_ a burden. ^18

19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. ^19

20 At that time will I bring you _again_, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20
