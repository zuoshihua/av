### Deuteronomy 3

1 THEN we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. ^1

2 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. ^2

3 So the $L{\small ORD}$ our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. ^3

4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. ^4

5 All these cities _were_ fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. ^5

6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. ^6

7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. ^7

8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that _was_ on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; ^8

9 (_Which_ Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) ^9

10 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. ^10

11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead _was_ a bedstead of iron; _is_ it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits _was_ the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. ^11

12 And this land, _which_ we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which _is_ by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. ^12

13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, _being_ the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. ^13

14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day. ^14

15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir. ^15

16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, _which_ _is_ the border of the children of Ammon; ^16

17 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast _thereof_, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, _even_ the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward. ^17

18 ¶ And I commanded you at that time, saying, The $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all _that_ _are_ meet for the war. ^18

19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (_for_ I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; ^19

20 Until the $L{\small ORD}$ have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and _until_ they also possess the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and _then_ shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. ^20

21 ¶ And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the $L{\small ORD}$ do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. ^21

22 Ye shall not fear them: for the $L{\small ORD}$ your God he shall fight for you. ^22

23 And I besought the $L{\small ORD}$ at that time, saying, ^23

24 O Lord $G{\small OD}$, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God _is_ _there_ in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? ^24

25 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that _is_ beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. ^25

26 But the $L{\small ORD}$ was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. ^26

27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold _it_ with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. ^27

28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. ^28

29 So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor. ^29
