### Deuteronomy 34

1 AND Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that _is_ over against Jericho. And the $L{\small ORD}$ shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, ^1

2 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, ^2

3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. ^3

4 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto him, This _is_ the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see _it_ with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. ^4

5 ¶ So Moses the servant of the $L{\small ORD}$ died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. ^6

7 ¶ And Moses _was_ an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. ^7

8 ¶ And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping _and_ mourning for Moses were ended. ^8

9 ¶ And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses. ^9

10 ¶ And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the $L{\small ORD}$ knew face to face, ^10

11 In all the signs and the wonders, which the $L{\small ORD}$ sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, ^11

12 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel. ^12
