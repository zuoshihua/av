### Deuteronomy 9

1 HEAR, O Israel: Thou _art_ to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven, ^1

2 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and _of_ _whom_ thou hast heard _say_, Who can stand before the children of Anak! ^2

3 Understand therefore this day, that the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God _is_ he which goeth over before thee; _as_ a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the $L{\small ORD}$ hath said unto thee. ^3

4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the $L{\small ORD}$ hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the $L{\small ORD}$ doth drive them out from before thee. ^4

5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the $L{\small ORD}$ sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. ^5

6 Understand therefore, that the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou _art_ a stiffnecked people. ^6

7 Â¶ Remember, _and_ forget not, how thou provokedst the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the $L{\small ORD}$ to wrath, so that the $L{\small ORD}$ was angry with you to have destroyed you. ^8

9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, _even_ the tables of the covenant which the $L{\small ORD}$ made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water: ^9

10 And the $L{\small ORD}$ delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them _was_ _written_ according to all the words, which the $L{\small ORD}$ spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. ^10

11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, _that_ the $L{\small ORD}$ gave me the two tables of stone, _even_ the tables of the covenant. ^11

12 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted _themselves;_ they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. ^12

13 Furthermore the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it _is_ a stiffnecked people: ^13

14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. ^14

15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant _were_ in my two hands. ^15

16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, _and_ had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the $L{\small ORD}$ had commanded you. ^16

17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. ^17

18 And I fell down before the $L{\small ORD}$, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, to provoke him to anger. ^18

19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the $L{\small ORD}$ was wroth against you to destroy you. But the $L{\small ORD}$ hearkened unto me at that time also. ^19

20 And the $L{\small ORD}$ was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. ^20

21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, _and_ ground _it_ very small, _even_ until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. ^21

22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the $L{\small ORD}$ to wrath. ^22

23 Likewise when the $L{\small ORD}$ sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. ^23

24 Ye have been rebellious against the $L{\small ORD}$ from the day that I knew you. ^24

25 Thus I fell down before the $L{\small ORD}$ forty days and forty nights, as I fell down _at_ _the_ _first;_ because the $L{\small ORD}$ had said he would destroy you. ^25

26 I prayed therefore unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, O Lord $G{\small OD}$, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. ^26

27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: ^27

28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the $L{\small ORD}$ was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. ^28

29 Yet they _are_ thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. ^29
