### Deuteronomy 26

1 AND it shall be, when thou _art_ come in unto the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee _for_ an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein; ^1

2 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee, and shalt put _it_ in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God shall choose to place his name there. ^2

3 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, that I am come unto the country which the $L{\small ORD}$ sware unto our fathers for to give us. ^3

4 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God. ^4

5 And thou shalt speak and say before the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, A Syrian ready to perish _was_ my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous: ^5

6 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: ^6

7 And when we cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$ God of our fathers, the $L{\small ORD}$ heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression: ^7

8 And the $L{\small ORD}$ brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders: ^8

9 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, _even_ a land that floweth with milk and honey. ^9

10 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, and worship before the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God: ^10

11 And thou shalt rejoice in every good _thing_ which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that _is_ among you. ^11

12 ¶ When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, _which_ _is_ the year of tithing, and hast given _it_ unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled; ^12

13 Then thou shalt say before the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of _mine_ house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten _them:_ ^13

14 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away _ought_ thereof for _any_ unclean _use_, nor given _ought_ thereof for the dead: _but_ I have hearkened to the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ my God, _and_ have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. ^14

15 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey. ^15

16 ¶ This day the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. ^16

17 Thou hast avouched the $L{\small ORD}$ this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice: ^17

18 And the $L{\small ORD}$ hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that _thou_ shouldest keep all his commandments; ^18

19 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, as he hath spoken. ^19
