### Deuteronomy 18

1 THE priests the Levites, _and_ all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the $L{\small ORD}$ made by fire, and his inheritance. ^1

2 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ their inheritance, as he hath said unto them. ^2

3 ¶ And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether _it_ _be_ ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. ^3

4 The firstfruit _also_ of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him. ^4

5 For the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, him and his sons for ever. ^5

6 ¶ And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the $L{\small ORD}$ shall choose; ^6

7 Then he shall minister in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ his God, as all his brethren the Levites _do_, which stand there before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony. ^8

9 ¶ When thou art come into the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. ^9

10 There shall not be found among you _any_ _one_ that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, _or_ that useth divination, _or_ an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, ^10

11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. ^11

12 For all that do these things _are_ an abomination unto the $L{\small ORD}$: and because of these abominations the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God doth drive them out from before thee. ^12

13 Thou shalt be perfect with the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God. ^13

14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath not suffered thee so _to_ _do_. ^14

15 ¶ The $L{\small ORD}$ thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; ^15

16 According to all that thou desiredst of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not. ^16

17 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, They have well _spoken_ _that_ which they have spoken. ^17

18 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. ^18

19 And it shall come to pass, _that_ whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require _it_ of him. ^19

20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. ^20

21 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath not spoken? ^21

22 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that _is_ the thing which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath not spoken, _but_ the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him. ^22
