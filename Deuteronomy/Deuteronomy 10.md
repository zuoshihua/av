### Deuteronomy 10

1 AT that time the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. ^1

2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. ^2

3 And I made an ark _of_ shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. ^3

4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the $L{\small ORD}$ gave them unto me. ^4

5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded me. ^5

6 ¶ And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. ^6

7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. ^7

8 ¶ At that time the $L{\small ORD}$ separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$, to stand before the $L{\small ORD}$ to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. ^8

9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ his inheritance, according as the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God promised him. ^9

10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the $L{\small ORD}$ hearkened unto me at that time also, _and_ the $L{\small ORD}$ would not destroy thee. ^10

11 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, Arise, take _thy_ journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them. ^11

12 ¶ And now, Israel, what doth the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God require of thee, but to fear the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, ^12

13 To keep the commandments of the $L{\small ORD}$, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good? ^13

14 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s thy God, the earth _also_, with all that therein _is_. ^14

15 Only the $L{\small ORD}$ had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, _even_ you above all people, as _it_ _is_ this day. ^15

16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. ^16

17 For the $L{\small ORD}$ your God _is_ God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward: ^17

18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. ^18

19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. ^19

20 Thou shalt fear the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. ^20

21 He _is_ thy praise, and he _is_ thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen. ^21

22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude. ^22
