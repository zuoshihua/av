### Deuteronomy 29

1 THESE _are_ the words of the covenant, which the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. ^1

2 ¶ And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the $L{\small ORD}$ did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; ^2

3 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles: ^3

4 Yet the $L{\small ORD}$ hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day. ^4

5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. ^5

6 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^6

7 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: ^7

8 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. ^8

9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do. ^9

10 ¶ Ye stand this day all of you before the $L{\small ORD}$ your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, _with_ all the men of Israel, ^10

11 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that _is_ in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water: ^11

12 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, and into his oath, which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God maketh with thee this day: ^12

13 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and _that_ he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. ^13

14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; ^14

15 But with _him_ that standeth here with us this day before the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, and also with _him_ that _is_ not here with us this day: ^15

16 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by; ^16

17 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which _were_ among them:) ^17

18 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, to go _and_ serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; ^18

19 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: ^19

20 The $L{\small ORD}$ will not spare him, but then the anger of the $L{\small ORD}$ and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the $L{\small ORD}$ shall blot out his name from under heaven. ^20

21 And the $L{\small ORD}$ shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law: ^21

22 So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath laid upon it; ^22

23 _And_ _that_ the whole land thereof _is_ brimstone, and salt, _and_ burning, _that_ it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the $L{\small ORD}$ overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: ^23

24 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the $L{\small ORD}$ done thus unto this land? what _meaneth_ the heat of this great anger? ^24

25 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: ^25

26 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and _whom_ he had not given unto them: ^26

27 And the anger of the $L{\small ORD}$ was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book: ^27

28 And the $L{\small ORD}$ rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as _it_ _is_ this day. ^28

29 The secret _things_ _belong_ unto the $L{\small ORD}$ our God: but those _things_ _which_ _are_ revealed _belong_ unto us and to our children for ever, that _we_ may do all the words of this law. ^29
