### Deuteronomy 5

1 AND Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, _even_ us, who _are_ all of us here alive this day. ^3

4 The $L{\small ORD}$ talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, ^4

5 (I stood between the $L{\small ORD}$ and you at that time, to shew you the word of the $L{\small ORD}$: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, ^5

6 ¶ I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. ^6

7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me. ^7

8 Thou shalt not make thee _any_ graven image, _or_ any likeness _of_ _any_ _thing_ that _is_ in heaven above, or that _is_ in the earth beneath, or that _is_ in the waters beneath the earth: ^8

9 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God _am_ a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth _generation_ of them that hate me, ^9

10 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. ^10

11 Thou shalt not take the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God in vain: for the $L{\small ORD}$ will not hold _him_ guiltless that taketh his name in vain. ^11

12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath commanded thee. ^12

13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: ^13

14 But the seventh day _is_ the sabbath of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God: _in_ _it_ thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that _is_ within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. ^14

15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and _that_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. ^15

16 ¶ Honour thy father and thy mother, as the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee. ^16

17 Thou shalt not kill. ^17

18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery. ^18

19 Neither shalt thou steal. ^19

20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. ^20

21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any _thing_ that _is_ thy neighbour's. ^21

22 ¶ These words the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. ^22

23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, _even_ all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; ^23

24 And ye said, Behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. ^24

25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God any more, then we shall die. ^25

26 For who _is_ _there_ _of_ all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we _have_, and lived? ^26

27 Go thou near, and hear all that the $L{\small ORD}$ our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the $L{\small ORD}$ our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear _it_, and do _it_. ^27

28 And the $L{\small ORD}$ heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken. ^28

29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! ^29

30 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. ^30

31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do _them_ in the land which I give them to possess it. ^31

32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. ^32

33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and _that_ _it_ _may_ _be_ well with you, and _that_ ye may prolong _your_ days in the land which ye shall possess. ^33
