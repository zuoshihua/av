### Deuteronomy 33

1 AND this _is_ the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. ^1

2 And he said, The $L{\small ORD}$ came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand _went_ a fiery law for them. ^2

3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints _are_ in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; _every_ _one_ shall receive of thy words. ^3

4 Moses commanded us a law, _even_ the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. ^4

5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people _and_ the tribes of Israel were gathered together. ^5

6 ¶ Let Reuben live, and not die; and let _not_ his men be few. ^6

7 ¶ And this _is_ _the_ _blessing_ of Judah: and he said, Hear, $L{\small ORD}$, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help _to_ _him_ from his enemies. ^7

8 ¶ And of Levi he said, _Let_ thy Thummim and thy Urim _be_ with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, _and_ _with_ whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; ^8

9 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. ^9

10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. ^10

11 Bless, $L{\small ORD}$, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. ^11

12 ¶ _And_ of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall dwell in safety by him; _and_ _the_ _$L{\small ORD}$_ shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. ^12

13 ¶ And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the $L{\small ORD}$ _be_ his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, ^13

14 And for the precious fruits _brought_ _forth_ by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, ^14

15 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, ^15

16 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and _for_ the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let _the_ _blessing_ come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him _that_ _was_ separated from his brethren. ^16

17 His glory _is_ _like_ the firstling of his bullock, and his horns _are_ _like_ the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they _are_ the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they _are_ the thousands of Manasseh. ^17

18 ¶ And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents. ^18

19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck _of_ the abundance of the seas, and _of_ treasures hid in the sand. ^19

20 ¶ And of Gad he said, Blessed _be_ he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head. ^20

21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, _in_ a portion of the lawgiver, _was_ _he_ seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the $L{\small ORD}$, and his judgments with Israel. ^21

22 ¶ And of Dan he said, Dan _is_ a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. ^22

23 ¶ And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the $L{\small ORD}$: possess thou the west and the south. ^23

24 ¶ And of Asher he said, _Let_ Asher _be_ blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. ^24

25 Thy shoes _shall_ _be_ iron and brass; and as thy days, _so_ _shall_ thy strength _be_. ^25

26 ¶ _There_ _is_ none like unto the God of Jeshurun, _who_ rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. ^26

27 The eternal God _is_ _thy_ refuge, and underneath _are_ the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy _them_. ^27

28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob _shall_ _be_ upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew. ^28

29 Happy _art_ thou, O Israel: who _is_ like unto thee, O people saved by the $L{\small ORD}$, the shield of thy help, and who _is_ the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. ^29
