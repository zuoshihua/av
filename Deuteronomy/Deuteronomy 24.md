### Deuteronomy 24

1 WHEN a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give _it_ in her hand, and send her out of his house. ^1

2 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's _wife_. ^2

3 And _if_ the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth _it_ in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her _to_ _be_ his wife; ^3

4 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that _is_ abomination before the $L{\small ORD}$: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee _for_ an inheritance. ^4

5 ¶ When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: _but_ he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken. ^5

6 ¶ No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh _a_ _man_'_s_ life to pledge. ^6

7 ¶ If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you. ^7

8 ¶ Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, _so_ ye shall observe to do. ^8

9 Remember what the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt. ^9

10 ¶ When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. ^10

11 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. ^11

12 And if the man _be_ poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge: ^12

13 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God. ^13

14 ¶ Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant _that_ _is_ poor and needy, _whether_ _he_ _be_ of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that _are_ in thy land within thy gates: ^14

15 At his day thou shalt give _him_ his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he _is_ poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and it be sin unto thee. ^15

16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. ^16

17 ¶ Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, _nor_ of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: ^17

18 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing. ^18

19 ¶ When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands. ^19

20 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. ^20

21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean _it_ afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. ^21

22 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing. ^22
