### Deuteronomy 27

1 AND Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day. ^1

2 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister: ^2

3 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the $L{\small ORD}$ God of thy fathers hath promised thee. ^3

4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, _that_ ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister. ^4

5 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up _any_ iron _tool_ upon them. ^5

6 Thou shalt build the altar of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God: ^6

7 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God. ^7

8 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly. ^8

9 ¶ And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God. ^9

10 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day. ^10

11 ¶ And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, ^11

12 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin: ^12

13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. ^13

14 ¶ And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice, ^14

15 Cursed _be_ the man that maketh _any_ graven or molten image, an abomination unto the $L{\small ORD}$, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth _it_ in _a_ secret _place_. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen. ^15

16 Cursed _be_ he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^16

17 Cursed _be_ he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^17

18 Cursed _be_ he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^18

19 Cursed _be_ he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^19

20 Cursed _be_ he that lieth with his father's wife; because he uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^20

21 Cursed _be_ he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^21

22 Cursed _be_ he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^22

23 Cursed _be_ he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^23

24 Cursed _be_ he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^24

25 Cursed _be_ he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^25

26 Cursed _be_ he that confirmeth not _all_ the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen. ^26
