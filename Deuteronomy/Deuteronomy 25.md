### Deuteronomy 25

1 IF there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that _the_ _judges_ may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked. ^1

2 And it shall be, if the wicked man _be_ worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number. ^2

3 Forty stripes he may give him, _and_ not exceed: lest, _if_ he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee. ^3

4 ¶ Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out _the_ _corn_. ^4

5 ¶ If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her. ^5

6 And it shall be, _that_ the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother _which_ _is_ dead, that his name be not put out of Israel. ^6

7 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother. ^7

8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and _if_ he stand _to_ _it_, and say, I like not to take her; ^8

9 Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house. ^9

10 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed. ^10

11 ¶ When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: ^11

12 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity _her_. ^12

13 ¶ Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. ^13

14 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small. ^14

15 _But_ thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee. ^15

16 For all that do such things, _and_ all that do unrighteously, _are_ an abomination unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God. ^16

17 ¶ Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; ^17

18 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, _even_ all _that_ _were_ feeble behind thee, when thou _wast_ faint and weary; and he feared not God. ^18

19 Therefore it shall be, when the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee _for_ an inheritance to possess it, _that_ thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget _it_. ^19
