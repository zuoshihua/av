### Leviticus 1

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, _even_ of the herd, and of the flock. ^2

3 If his offering _be_ a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. ^4

5 And he shall kill the bullock before the $L{\small ORD}$: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that _is_ _by_ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. ^5

6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. ^6

7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire: ^7

8 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that _is_ on the fire which _is_ upon the altar: ^8

9 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, _to_ _be_ a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 ¶ And if his offering _be_ of the flocks, _namely_, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. ^10

11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the $L{\small ORD}$: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. ^11

12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that _is_ on the fire which _is_ upon the altar: ^12

13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring _it_ all, and burn _it_ upon the altar: it _is_ a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 ¶ And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the $L{\small ORD}$ _be_ of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. ^14

15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn _it_ on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: ^15

16 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: ^16

17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, _but_ shall not divide _it_ asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that _is_ upon the fire: it _is_ a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17
