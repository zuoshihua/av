### Leviticus 11

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, ^1

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These _are_ the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that _are_ on the earth. ^2

3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, _and_ cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. ^3

4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: _as_ the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he _is_ unclean unto you. ^4

5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he _is_ unclean unto you. ^5

6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he _is_ unclean unto you. ^6

7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he _is_ unclean to you. ^7

8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they _are_ unclean to you. ^8

9 ¶ These shall ye eat of all that _are_ in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. ^9

10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which _is_ in the waters, they _shall_ _be_ an abomination unto you: ^10

11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. ^11

12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that _shall_ _be_ an abomination unto you. ^12

13 ¶ And these _are_ _they_ _which_ ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they _are_ an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, ^13

14 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; ^14

15 Every raven after his kind; ^15

16 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, ^16

17 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, ^17

18 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, ^18

19 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. ^19

20 All fowls that creep, going upon _all_ four, _shall_ _be_ an abomination unto you. ^20

21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon _all_ four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; ^21

22 _Even_ these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. ^22

23 But all _other_ flying creeping things, which have four feet, _shall_ _be_ an abomination unto you. ^23

24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even. ^24

25 And whosoever beareth _ought_ of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. ^25

26 _The_ _carcases_ of every beast which divideth the hoof, and _is_ not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, _are_ unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. ^26

27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on _all_ four, those _are_ unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. ^27

28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they _are_ unclean unto you. ^28

29 ¶ These also _shall_ _be_ unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind, ^29

30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. ^30

31 These _are_ unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. ^31

32 And upon whatsoever _any_ of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether _it_ _be_ any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel _it_ _be_, wherein _any_ work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed. ^32

33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto _any_ of them falleth, whatsoever _is_ in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. ^33

34 Of all meat which may be eaten, _that_ on which _such_ water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every _such_ vessel shall be unclean. ^34

35 And every _thing_ whereupon _any_ _part_ of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; _whether_ _it_ _be_ oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: _for_ they _are_ unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. ^35

36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, _wherein_ _there_ _is_ plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. ^36

37 And if _any_ _part_ of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it _shall_ _be_ clean. ^37

38 But if _any_ water be put upon the seed, and _any_ _part_ of their carcase fall thereon, it _shall_ _be_ unclean unto you. ^38

39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. ^39

40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. ^40

41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth _shall_ _be_ an abomination; it shall not be eaten. ^41

42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon _all_ four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they _are_ an abomination. ^42

43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. ^43

44 For I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I _am_ holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. ^44

45 For I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I _am_ holy. ^45

46 This _is_ the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: ^46

47 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten. ^47
