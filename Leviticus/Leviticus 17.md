### Leviticus 17

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This _is_ the thing which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath commanded, saying, ^2

3 What man soever _there_ _be_ of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth _it_ out of the camp, ^3

4 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$ before the tabernacle of the $L{\small ORD}$; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people: ^4

5 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the $L{\small ORD}$, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them _for_ peace offerings unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the $L{\small ORD}$ _at_ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. ^7

8 ¶ And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man _there_ _be_ of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, ^8

9 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the $L{\small ORD}$; even that man shall be cut off from among his people. ^9

10 ¶ And whatsoever man _there_ _be_ of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. ^10

11 For the life of the flesh _is_ in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it _is_ the blood _that_ maketh an atonement for the soul. ^11

12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. ^12

13 And whatsoever man _there_ _be_ of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. ^13

14 For _it_ _is_ the life of all flesh; the blood of it _is_ for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh _is_ the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. ^14

15 And every soul that eateth that which died _of_ _itself_, or that which was torn _with_ _beasts_, _whether_ _it_ _be_ one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe _himself_ in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean. ^15

16 But if he wash _them_ not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity. ^16
