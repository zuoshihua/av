### Leviticus 22

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name _in_ _those_ _things_ which they hallow unto me: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^2

3 Say unto them, Whosoever _he_ _be_ of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the $L{\small ORD}$, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron _is_ a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing _that_ _is_ unclean _by_ the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; ^4

5 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; ^5

6 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water. ^6

7 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it _is_ his food. ^7

8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn _with_ _beasts_, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the $L{\small ORD}$ do sanctify them. ^9

10 There shall no stranger eat _of_ the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat _of_ the holy thing. ^10

11 But if the priest buy _any_ soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat. ^11

12 If the priest's daughter also be _married_ unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things. ^12

13 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof. ^13

14 ¶ And if a man eat _of_ the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth _part_ thereof unto it, and shall give _it_ unto the priest with the holy thing. ^14

15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the $L{\small ORD}$; ^15

16 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the $L{\small ORD}$ do sanctify them. ^16

17 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^17

18 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever _he_ _be_ of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the $L{\small ORD}$ for a burnt offering; ^18

19 _Ye_ _shall_ _offer_ at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. ^19

20 _But_ whatsoever hath a blemish, _that_ shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you. ^20

21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the $L{\small ORD}$ to accomplish _his_ vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. ^21

22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the $L{\small ORD}$, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^22

23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer _for_ a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. ^23

24 Ye shall not offer unto the $L{\small ORD}$ that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make _any_ _offering_ _thereof_ in your land. ^24

25 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption _is_ in them, _and_ blemishes _be_ in them: they shall not be accepted for you. ^25

26 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^26

27 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^27

28 And _whether_ _it_ _be_ cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day. ^28

29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the $L{\small ORD}$, offer _it_ at your own will. ^29

30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^30

31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^31

32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ which hallow you, ^32

33 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^33
