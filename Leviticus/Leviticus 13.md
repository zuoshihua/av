### Leviticus 13

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, ^1

2 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh _like_ the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: ^2

3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and _when_ the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight _be_ deeper than the skin of his flesh, it _is_ a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. ^3

4 If the bright spot _be_ white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight _be_ not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up _him_ _that_ _hath_ the plague seven days: ^4

5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, _if_ the plague in his sight be at a stay, _and_ the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: ^5

6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, _if_ the plague _be_ somewhat dark, _and_ the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it _is_ _but_ a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. ^6

7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again: ^7

8 And _if_ the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it _is_ a leprosy. ^8

9 ¶ When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest; ^9

10 And the priest shall see _him:_ and, behold, _if_ the rising _be_ white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and _there_ _be_ quick raw flesh in the rising; ^10

11 It _is_ an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he _is_ unclean. ^11

12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of _him_ _that_ _hath_ the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; ^12

13 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, _if_ the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce _him_ clean _that_ _hath_ the plague: it is all turned white: he _is_ clean. ^13

14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. ^14

15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: _for_ the raw flesh _is_ unclean: it _is_ a leprosy. ^15

16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest; ^16

17 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, _if_ the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce _him_ clean _that_ _hath_ the plague: he _is_ clean. ^17

18 ¶ The flesh also, in which, _even_ in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed, ^18

19 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest; ^19

20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it _be_ in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it _is_ a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil. ^20

21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, _there_ _be_ no white hairs therein, and _if_ it _be_ not lower than the skin, but _be_ somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: ^21

22 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it _is_ a plague. ^22

23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, _and_ spread not, it _is_ a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. ^23

24 ¶ Or if there be _any_ flesh, in the skin whereof _there_ _is_ a hot burning, and the quick _flesh_ that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white; ^24

25 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, _if_ the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it _be_ _in_ sight deeper than the skin; it _is_ a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it _is_ the plague of leprosy. ^25

26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, _there_ _be_ no white hair in the bright spot, and it _be_ no lower than the _other_ skin, but _be_ somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: ^26

27 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: _and_ if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it _is_ the plague of leprosy. ^27

28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, _and_ spread not in the skin, but it _be_ somewhat dark; it _is_ a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it _is_ an inflammation of the burning. ^28

29 ¶ If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; ^29

30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it _be_ in sight deeper than the skin; _and_ _there_ _be_ in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it _is_ a dry scall, _even_ a leprosy upon the head or beard. ^30

31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it _be_ not in sight deeper than the skin, and _that_ _there_ _is_ no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up _him_ _that_ _hath_ the plague of the scall seven days: ^31

32 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, _if_ the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall _be_ not in sight deeper than the skin; ^32

33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up _him_ _that_ _hath_ the scall seven days more: ^33

34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, _if_ the scall be not spread in the skin, nor _be_ in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. ^34

35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; ^35

36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he _is_ unclean. ^36

37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and _that_ there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he _is_ clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean. ^37

38 ¶ If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, _even_ white bright spots; ^38

39 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, _if_ the bright spots in the skin of their flesh _be_ darkish white; it _is_ a freckled spot _that_ groweth in the skin; he _is_ clean. ^39

40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he _is_ bald; _yet_ _is_ he clean. ^40

41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he _is_ forehead bald: _yet_ _is_ he clean. ^41

42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it _is_ a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead. ^42

43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, _if_ the rising of the sore _be_ white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; ^43

44 He is a leprous man, he _is_ unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague _is_ in his head. ^44

45 And the leper in whom the plague _is_, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean. ^45

46 All the days wherein the plague _shall_ _be_ in him he shall be defiled; he _is_ unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp _shall_ his habitation _be_. ^46

47 ¶ The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, _whether_ _it_ _be_ a woollen garment, or a linen garment; ^47

48 Whether _it_ _be_ in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; ^48

49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it _is_ a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: ^49

50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up _it_ _that_ _hath_ the plague seven days: ^50

51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, _or_ in any work that is made of skin; the plague _is_ a fretting leprosy; it _is_ unclean. ^51

52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it _is_ a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. ^52

53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; ^53

54 Then the priest shall command that they wash _the_ _thing_ wherein the plague _is_, and he shall shut it up seven days more: ^54

55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, _if_ the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it _is_ unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it _is_ fret inward, _whether_ it _be_ bare within or without. ^55

56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague _be_ somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: ^56

57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it _is_ a spreading _plague:_ thou shalt burn that wherein the plague _is_ with fire. ^57

58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin _it_ _be_, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. ^58

59 This _is_ the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. ^59
