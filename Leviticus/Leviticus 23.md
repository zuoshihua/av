### Leviticus 23

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, _Concerning_ the feasts of the $L{\small ORD}$, which ye shall proclaim _to_ _be_ holy convocations, _even_ these _are_ my feasts. ^2

3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day _is_ the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work _therein:_ it _is_ the sabbath of the $L{\small ORD}$ in all your dwellings. ^3

4 ¶ These _are_ the feasts of the $L{\small ORD}$, _even_ holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons. ^4

5 In the fourteenth _day_ of the first month at even _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s passover. ^5

6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month _is_ the feast of unleavened bread unto the $L{\small ORD}$: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. ^6

7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. ^7

8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$ seven days: in the seventh day _is_ an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work _therein_. ^8

9 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^9

10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: ^10

11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the $L{\small ORD}$, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. ^11

12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12

13 And the meat offering thereof _shall_ _be_ two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$ _for_ a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof _shall_ _be_ of wine, the fourth _part_ of an hin. ^13

14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: _it_ _shall_ _be_ a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. ^14

15 ¶ And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete: ^15

16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; _they_ _are_ the firstfruits unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be _for_ a burnt offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, _even_ an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^18

19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. ^19

20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits _for_ a wave offering before the $L{\small ORD}$, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the $L{\small ORD}$ for the priest. ^20

21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, _that_ it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work _therein:_ _it_ _shall_ _be_ a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. ^21

22 ¶ And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^22

23 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^23

24 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first _day_ of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. ^24

25 Ye shall do no servile work _therein:_ but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^25

26 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^26

27 Also on the tenth _day_ of this seventh month _there_ _shall_ _be_ a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^27

28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it _is_ a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^28

29 For whatsoever soul _it_ _be_ that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. ^29

30 And whatsoever soul _it_ _be_ that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. ^30

31 Ye shall do no manner of work: _it_ _shall_ _be_ a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. ^31

32 It _shall_ _be_ unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth _day_ of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath. ^32

33 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^33

34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month _shall_ _be_ the feast of tabernacles _for_ seven days unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^34

35 On the first day _shall_ _be_ an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work _therein_. ^35

36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$: it _is_ a solemn assembly; _and_ ye shall do no servile work _therein_. ^36

37 These _are_ the feasts of the $L{\small ORD}$, which ye shall proclaim _to_ _be_ holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: ^37

38 Beside the sabbaths of the $L{\small ORD}$, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^38

39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the $L{\small ORD}$ seven days: on the first day _shall_ _be_ a sabbath, and on the eighth day _shall_ _be_ a sabbath. ^39

40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the $L{\small ORD}$ your God seven days. ^40

41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the $L{\small ORD}$ seven days in the year. _It_ _shall_ _be_ a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. ^41

42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: ^42

43 That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^43

44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^44
