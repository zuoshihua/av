### Leviticus 3

1 AND if his oblation _be_ a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer _it_ of the herd; whether _it_ _be_ a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it _at_ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. ^2

3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that _is_ upon the inwards, ^3

4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that _is_ on them, which _is_ by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. ^4

5 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which _is_ upon the wood that _is_ on the fire: _it_ _is_ an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 ¶ And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$ _be_ of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. ^6

7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar. ^8

9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$; the fat thereof, _and_ the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that _is_ upon the inwards, ^9

10 And the two kidneys, and the fat that _is_ upon them, which _is_ by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. ^10

11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: _it_ _is_ the food of the offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^11

12 ¶ And if his offering _be_ a goat, then he shall offer it before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12

13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. ^13

14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, _even_ an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that _is_ upon the inwards, ^14

15 And the two kidneys, and the fat that _is_ upon them, which _is_ by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. ^15

16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: _it_ _is_ the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s. ^16

17 _It_ _shall_ _be_ a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood. ^17
