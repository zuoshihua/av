### Leviticus 2

1 AND when any will offer a meat offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$, his offering shall be _of_ fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: ^1

2 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, _to_ _be_ an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$: ^2

3 And the remnant of the meat offering _shall_ _be_ Aaron's and his sons': _it_ _is_ a thing most holy of the offerings of the $L{\small ORD}$ made by fire. ^3

4 ¶ And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, _it_ _shall_ _be_ unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. ^4

5 ¶ And if thy oblation _be_ a meat offering _baken_ in a pan, it shall be _of_ fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. ^5

6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it _is_ a meat offering. ^6

7 ¶ And if thy oblation _be_ a meat offering _baken_ in the fryingpan, it shall be made _of_ fine flour with oil. ^7

8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the $L{\small ORD}$: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar. ^8

9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn _it_ upon the altar: _it_ _is_ an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 And that which is left of the meat offering _shall_ _be_ Aaron's and his sons': _it_ _is_ a thing most holy of the offerings of the $L{\small ORD}$ made by fire. ^10

11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the $L{\small ORD}$, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the $L{\small ORD}$ made by fire. ^11

12 ¶ As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the $L{\small ORD}$: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour. ^12

13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. ^13

14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the $L{\small ORD}$, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, _even_ corn beaten out of full ears. ^14

15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it _is_ a meat offering. ^15

16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, _part_ of the beaten corn thereof, and _part_ of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: _it_ _is_ an offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16
