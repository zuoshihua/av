### Leviticus 27

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons _shall_ _be_ for the $L{\small ORD}$ by thy estimation. ^2

3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. ^3

4 And if it _be_ a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. ^4

5 And if _it_ _be_ from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. ^5

6 And if _it_ _be_ from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation _shall_ _be_ three shekels of silver. ^6

7 And if _it_ _be_ from sixty years old and above; if _it_ _be_ a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. ^7

8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. ^8

9 And if _it_ _be_ a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$, all that _any_ _man_ giveth of such unto the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be holy. ^9

10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy. ^10

11 And if _it_ _be_ any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the $L{\small ORD}$, then he shall present the beast before the priest: ^11

12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, _who_ _art_ the priest, so shall it be. ^12

13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth _part_ thereof unto thy estimation. ^13

14 ¶ And when a man shall sanctify his house _to_ _be_ holy unto the $L{\small ORD}$, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. ^14

15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth _part_ of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his. ^15

16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the $L{\small ORD}$ _some_ _part_ of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed _shall_ _be_ _valued_ at fifty shekels of silver. ^16

17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand. ^17

18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. ^18

19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth _part_ of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. ^19

20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. ^20

21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the $L{\small ORD}$, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's. ^21

22 And if _a_ _man_ sanctify unto the $L{\small ORD}$ a field which he hath bought, which _is_ not of the fields of his possession; ^22

23 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, _even_ unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, _as_ a holy thing unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^23

24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, _even_ to him to whom the possession of the land _did_ _belong_. ^24

25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. ^25

26 ¶ Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the $L{\small ORD}$'s firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether _it_ _be_ ox, or sheep: it _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s. ^26

27 And if _it_ _be_ of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem _it_ according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth _part_ of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. ^27

28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the $L{\small ORD}$ of all that he hath, _both_ of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing _is_ most holy unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^28

29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; _but_ shall surely be put to death. ^29

30 And all the tithe of the land, _whether_ of the seed of the land, _or_ of the fruit of the tree, _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s: _it_ _is_ holy unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^30

31 And if a man will at all redeem _ought_ of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth _part_ thereof. ^31

32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, _even_ of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^32

33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. ^33

34 These _are_ the commandments, which the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. ^34
