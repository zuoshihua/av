### Leviticus 25

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^2

3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; ^3

4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the $L{\small ORD}$: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. ^4

5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: _for_ it is a year of rest unto the land. ^5

6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee, ^6

7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that _are_ in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat. ^7

8 ¶ And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. ^8

9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth _day_ of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. ^9

10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout _all_ the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. ^10

11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather _the_ _grapes_ in it of thy vine undressed. ^11

12 For it _is_ the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. ^12

13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession. ^13

14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest _ought_ of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: ^14

15 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, _and_ according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: ^15

16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for _according_ to the number _of_ _the_ _years_ of the fruits doth he sell unto thee. ^16

17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^17

18 ¶ Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. ^18

19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. ^19

20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: ^20

21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years. ^21

22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat _yet_ of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat _of_ the old _store_. ^22

23 ¶ The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land _is_ mine; for ye _are_ strangers and sojourners with me. ^23

24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. ^24

25 ¶ If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away _some_ of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold. ^25

26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; ^26

27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession. ^27

28 But if he be not able to restore _it_ to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession. ^28

29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; _within_ a full year may he redeem it. ^29

30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that _is_ in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile. ^30

31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile. ^31

32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, _and_ the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. ^32

33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in _the_ _year_ _of_ jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites _are_ their possession among the children of Israel. ^33

34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it _is_ their perpetual possession. ^34

35 ¶ And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: _yea_, _though_ _he_ _be_ a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. ^35

36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. ^36

37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. ^37

38 I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, _and_ to be your God. ^38

39 ¶ And if thy brother _that_ _dwelleth_ by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: ^39

40 _But_ as an hired servant, _and_ as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, _and_ shall serve thee unto the year of jubile: ^40

41 And _then_ shall he depart from thee, _both_ he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. ^41

42 For they _are_ my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. ^42

43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. ^43

44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, _shall_ _be_ of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. ^44

45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that _are_ with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. ^45

46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit _them_ _for_ a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour. ^46

47 ¶ And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother _that_ _dwelleth_ by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger _or_ sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: ^47

48 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him: ^48

49 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or _any_ that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself. ^49

50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him. ^50

51 If _there_ _be_ yet many years _behind_, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. ^51

52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, _and_ according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption. ^52

53 _And_ as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: _and_ _the_ _other_ shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. ^53

54 And if he be not redeemed in these _years_, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, _both_ he, and his children with him. ^54

55 For unto me the children of Israel _are_ servants; they _are_ my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^55
