### Leviticus 4

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the $L{\small ORD}$ _concerning_ _things_ which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: ^2

3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the $L{\small ORD}$ for a sin offering. ^3

4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the $L{\small ORD}$; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: ^5

6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the $L{\small ORD}$, before the vail of the sanctuary. ^6

7 And the priest shall put _some_ of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the $L{\small ORD}$, which _is_ in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which _is_ _at_ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. ^7

8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that _is_ upon the inwards, ^8

9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that _is_ upon them, which _is_ by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away, ^9

10 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering. ^10

11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, ^11

12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. ^12

13 ¶ And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done _somewhat_ _against_ any of the commandments of the $L{\small ORD}$ _concerning_ _things_ which should not be done, and are guilty; ^13

14 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. ^14

15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the $L{\small ORD}$: and the bullock shall be killed before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^15

16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: ^16

17 And the priest shall dip his finger _in_ _some_ of the blood, and sprinkle _it_ seven times before the $L{\small ORD}$, _even_ before the vail. ^17

18 And he shall put _some_ of the blood upon the horns of the altar which _is_ before the $L{\small ORD}$, that _is_ in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which _is_ _at_ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. ^18

19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn _it_ upon the altar. ^19

20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. ^20

21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it _is_ a sin offering for the congregation. ^21

22 ¶ When a ruler hath sinned, and done _somewhat_ through ignorance _against_ any of the commandments of the $L{\small ORD}$ his God _concerning_ _things_ which should not be done, and is guilty; ^22

23 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: ^23

24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the $L{\small ORD}$: it _is_ a sin offering. ^24

25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put _it_ upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering. ^25

26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. ^26

27 ¶ And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth _somewhat_ _against_ any of the commandments of the $L{\small ORD}$ _concerning_ _things_ which ought not to be done, and be guilty; ^27

28 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. ^28

29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. ^29

30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put _it_ upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. ^30

31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn _it_ upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. ^31

32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. ^32

33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. ^33

34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put _it_ upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: ^34

35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him. ^35
