### Zechariah 5

1 THEN I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll. ^1

2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof _is_ twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. ^2

3 Then said he unto me, This _is_ the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off _as_ on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off _as_ on that side according to it. ^3

4 I will bring it forth, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. ^4

5 Â¶ Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what _is_ this that goeth forth. ^5

6 And I said, What _is_ it? And he said, This _is_ an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This _is_ their resemblance through all the earth. ^6

7 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this _is_ a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. ^7

8 And he said, This _is_ wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. ^8

9 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind _was_ in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. ^9

10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? ^10

11 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base. ^11
