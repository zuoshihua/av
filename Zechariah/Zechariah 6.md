### Zechariah 6

1 AND I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains _were_ mountains of brass. ^1

2 In the first chariot _were_ red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; ^2

3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. ^3

4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What _are_ these, my lord? ^4

5 And the angel answered and said unto me, These _are_ the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. ^5

6 The black horses which _are_ therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. ^6

7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. ^7

8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. ^8

9 Â¶ And the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^9

10 Take of _them_ _of_ the captivity, _even_ of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; ^10

11 Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set _them_ upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; ^11

12 And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name _is_ The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$: ^12

13 Even he shall build the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. ^13

14 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 And they _that_ _are_ far off shall come and build in the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$, and ye shall know that the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath sent me unto you. And _this_ shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^15
