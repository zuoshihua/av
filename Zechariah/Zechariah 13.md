### Zechariah 13

1 IN that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. ^1

2 ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, _that_ I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. ^2

3 And it shall come to pass, _that_ when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. ^3

4 And it shall come to pass in that day, _that_ the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: ^4

5 But he shall say, I _am_ no prophet, I _am_ an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. ^5

6 And _one_ shall say unto him, What _are_ these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, _Those_ with which I was wounded _in_ the house of my friends. ^6

7 ¶ Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man _that_ _is_ my fellow, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. ^7

8 And it shall come to pass, _that_ in all the land, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, two parts therein shall be cut off _and_ die; but the third shall be left therein. ^8

9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It _is_ my people: and they shall say, The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my God. ^9
