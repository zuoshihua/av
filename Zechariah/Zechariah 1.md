### Zechariah 1

1 IN the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath been sore displeased with your fathers. ^2

3 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^3

4 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and _from_ your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 Your fathers, where _are_ they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? ^5

6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us. ^6

7 ¶ Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which _is_ the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, ^7

8 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that _were_ in the bottom; and behind him _were_ _there_ red horses, speckled, and white. ^8

9 Then said I, O my lord, what _are_ these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these _be_. ^9

10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These _are_ _they_ whom the $L{\small ORD}$ hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. ^10

11 And they answered the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest. ^11

12 ¶ Then the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ answered and said, O $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? ^12

13 And the $L{\small ORD}$ answered the angel that talked with me _with_ good words _and_ comfortable words. ^13

14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. ^14

15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen _that_ _are_ at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. ^15

16 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. ^16

17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the $L{\small ORD}$ shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. ^17

18 ¶ Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. ^18

19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What _be_ these? And he answered me, These _are_ the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. ^19

20 And the $L{\small ORD}$ shewed me four carpenters. ^20

21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These _are_ the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up _their_ horn over the land of Judah to scatter it. ^21
