### Zechariah 8

1 AGAIN the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts came _to_ _me_, saying, ^1

2 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. ^2

3 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts the holy mountain. ^3

4 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age. ^4

5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. ^5

6 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^6

7 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; ^7

8 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness. ^8

9 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which _were_ in the day _that_ the foundation of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. ^9

10 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither _was_ _there_ _any_ peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. ^10

11 But now I _will_ not _be_ unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^11

12 For the seed _shall_ _be_ prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these _things_. ^12

13 And it shall come to pass, _that_ as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, _but_ let your hands be strong. ^13

14 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and I repented not: ^14

15 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. ^15

16 ¶ These _are_ the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: ^16

17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these _are_ _things_ that I hate, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 ¶ And the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts came unto me, saying, ^18

19 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; The fast of the fourth _month_, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. ^19

20 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; _It_ _shall_ yet _come_ _to_ _pass_, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: ^20

21 And the inhabitants of one _city_ shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the $L{\small ORD}$, and to seek the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts: I will go also. ^21

22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^22

23 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; In those days _it_ _shall_ _come_ _to_ _pass_, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard _that_ God _is_ with you. ^23
