### Zechariah 7

1 AND it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, _that_ the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto Zechariah in the fourth _day_ of the ninth month, _even_ in Chisleu; ^1

2 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the $L{\small ORD}$, ^2

3 _And_ to speak unto the priests which _were_ in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? ^3

4 ¶ Then came the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts unto me, saying, ^4

5 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh _month_, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, _even_ to me? ^5

6 And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat _for_ _yourselves_, and drink _for_ _yourselves?_ ^6

7 _Should_ _ye_ not _hear_ the words which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when _men_ inhabited the south and the plain? ^7

8 ¶ And the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto Zechariah, saying, ^8

9 Thus speaketh the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: ^9

10 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. ^10

11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. ^11

12 Yea, they made their hearts _as_ an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^12

13 Therefore it is come to pass, _that_ as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts: ^13

14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. ^14
