### Zechariah 4

1 AND the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, ^1

2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all _of_ gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which _are_ upon the top thereof: ^2

3 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right _side_ of the bowl, and the other upon the left _side_ thereof. ^3

4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What _are_ these, my lord? ^4

5 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. ^5

6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This _is_ the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^6

7 Who _art_ thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel _thou_ _shalt_ _become_ a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone _thereof_ _with_ shoutings, _crying_, Grace, grace unto it. ^7

8 Moreover the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^8

9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath sent me unto you. ^9

10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel _with_ those seven; they _are_ the eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$, which run to and fro through the whole earth. ^10

11 Â¶ Then answered I, and said unto him, What _are_ these two olive trees upon the right _side_ of the candlestick and upon the left _side_ thereof? ^11

12 And I answered again, and said unto him, What _be_ _these_ two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden _oil_ out of themselves? ^12

13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these _be?_ And I said, No, my lord. ^13

14 Then said he, These _are_ the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth. ^14
