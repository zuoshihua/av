### Zechariah 12

1 THE burden of the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ for Israel, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. ^1

2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah _and_ against Jerusalem. ^2

3 ¶ And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it. ^3

4 In that day, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. ^4

5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem _shall_ _be_ my strength in the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts their God. ^5

6 ¶ In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, _even_ in Jerusalem. ^6

7 The $L{\small ORD}$ also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify _themselves_ against Judah. ^7

8 In that day shall the $L{\small ORD}$ defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David _shall_ _be_ as God, as the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ before them. ^8

9 ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, _that_ I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. ^9

10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for _his_ only _son_, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for _his_ firstborn. ^10

11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. ^11

12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; ^12

13 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; ^13

14 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart. ^14
