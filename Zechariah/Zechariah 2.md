### Zechariah 2

1 I LIFTED up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. ^1

2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what _is_ the breadth thereof, and what _is_ the length thereof. ^2

3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, ^3

4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited _as_ towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein: ^4

5 For I, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. ^5

6 ¶ Ho, ho, _come_ _forth_, and flee from the land of the north, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest _with_ the daughter of Babylon. ^7

8 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. ^8

9 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath sent me. ^9

10 ¶ Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 And many nations shall be joined to the $L{\small ORD}$ in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath sent me unto thee. ^11

12 And the $L{\small ORD}$ shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. ^12

13 Be silent, O all flesh, before the $L{\small ORD}$: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation. ^13
