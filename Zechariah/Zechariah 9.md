### Zechariah 9

1 THE burden of the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus _shall_ _be_ the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, _shall_ _be_ toward the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise. ^2

3 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. ^3

4 Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. ^4

5 Ashkelon shall see _it_, and fear; Gaza also _shall_ _see_ _it_, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. ^5

6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. ^6

7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, _shall_ _be_ for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. ^7

8 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. ^8

9 ¶ Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he _is_ just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. ^9

10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion _shall_ _be_ from sea _even_ to sea, and from the river _even_ to the ends of the earth. ^10

11 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein _is_ no water. ^11

12 ¶ Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare _that_ I will render double unto thee; ^12

13 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man. ^13

14 And the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord $G{\small OD}$ shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south. ^14

15 The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, _and_ make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, _and_ as the corners of the altar. ^15

16 And the $L{\small ORD}$ their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for _they_ _shall_ _be_ _as_ the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land. ^16

17 For how great _is_ his goodness, and how great _is_ his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids. ^17
