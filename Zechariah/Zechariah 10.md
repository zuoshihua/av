### Zechariah 10

1 ASK ye of the $L{\small ORD}$ rain in the time of the latter rain; _so_ the $L{\small ORD}$ shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. ^1

2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because _there_ _was_ no shepherd. ^2

3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle. ^3

4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together. ^4

5 Â¶ And they shall be as mighty _men_, which tread down _their_ _enemies_ in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded. ^5

6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ their God, and will hear them. ^6

7 And _they_ _of_ Ephraim shall be like a mighty _man_, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see _it_, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. ^8

9 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. ^9

10 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and _place_ shall not be found for them. ^10

11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. ^11

12 And I will strengthen them in the $L{\small ORD}$; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12
