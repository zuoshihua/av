### Song of Solomon 6

1 WHITHER is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. ^1

2 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. ^2

3 I _am_ my beloved's, and my beloved _is_ mine: he feedeth among the lilies. ^3

4 ¶ Thou _art_ beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as _an_ _army_ with banners. ^4

5 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair _is_ as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. ^5

6 Thy teeth _are_ as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and _there_ _is_ not one barren among them. ^6

7 As a piece of a pomegranate _are_ thy temples within thy locks. ^7

8 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. ^8

9 My dove, my undefiled is _but_ one; she _is_ the _only_ one of her mother, she _is_ the choice _one_ of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; _yea_, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. ^9

10 ¶ Who _is_ she _that_ looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, _and_ terrible as _an_ _army_ with banners? ^10

11 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, _and_ to see whether the vine flourished, _and_ the pomegranates budded. ^11

12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me _like_ the chariots of Amminadib. ^12

13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. ^13
