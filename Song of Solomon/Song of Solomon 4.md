### Song of Solomon 4

1 BEHOLD, thou _art_ fair, my love; behold, thou _art_ fair; thou _hast_ doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair _is_ as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead. ^1

2 Thy teeth _are_ like a flock _of_ _sheep_ _that_ _are_ _even_ shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none _is_ barren among them. ^2

3 Thy lips _are_ like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech _is_ comely: thy temples _are_ like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. ^3

4 Thy neck _is_ like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. ^4

5 Thy two breasts _are_ like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies. ^5

6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. ^6

7 Thou _art_ all fair, my love; _there_ _is_ no spot in thee. ^7

8 ¶ Come with me from Lebanon, _my_ spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. ^8

9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, _my_ spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. ^9

10 How fair is thy love, my sister, _my_ spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices! ^10

11 Thy lips, O _my_ spouse, drop _as_ the honeycomb: honey and milk _are_ under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments _is_ like the smell of Lebanon. ^11

12 A garden inclosed _is_ my sister, _my_ spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. ^12

13 Thy plants _are_ an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, ^13

14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: ^14

15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon. ^15

16 ¶ Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, _that_ the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits. ^16
