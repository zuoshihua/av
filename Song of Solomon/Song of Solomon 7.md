### Song of Solomon 7

1 HOW beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs _are_ like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. ^1

2 Thy navel _is_ _like_ a round goblet, _which_ wanteth not liquor: thy belly _is_ _like_ an heap of wheat set about with lilies. ^2

3 Thy two breasts _are_ like two young roes _that_ _are_ twins. ^3

4 Thy neck _is_ as a tower of ivory; thine eyes _like_ the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose _is_ as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. ^4

5 Thine head upon thee _is_ like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king _is_ held in the galleries. ^5

6 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! ^6

7 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters _of_ _grapes_. ^7

8 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; ^8

9 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth _down_ sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak. ^9

10 Â¶ I _am_ my beloved's, and his desire _is_ toward me. ^10

11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. ^11

12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, _whether_ the tender grape appear, _and_ the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves. ^12

13 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates _are_ all manner of pleasant _fruits_, new and old, _which_ I have laid up for thee, O my beloved. ^13
