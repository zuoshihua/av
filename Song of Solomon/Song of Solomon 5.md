### Song of Solomon 5

1 I AM come into my garden, my sister, _my_ spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. ^1

2 ¶ I sleep, but my heart waketh: _it_ _is_ the voice of my beloved that knocketh, _saying_, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, _and_ my locks with the drops of the night. ^2

3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? ^3

4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole _of_ _the_ _door_, and my bowels were moved for him. ^4

5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped _with_ myrrh, and my fingers _with_ sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. ^5

6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, _and_ was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. ^6

7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. ^7

8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I _am_ sick of love. ^8

9 ¶ What _is_ thy beloved more than _another_ beloved, O thou fairest among women? what _is_ thy beloved more than _another_ beloved, that thou dost so charge us? ^9

10 My beloved _is_ white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. ^10

11 His head _is_ _as_ the most fine gold, his locks _are_ bushy, _and_ black as a raven. ^11

12 His eyes _are_ as _the_ _eyes_ of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, _and_ fitly set. ^12

13 His cheeks _are_ as a bed of spices, _as_ sweet flowers: his lips _like_ lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. ^13

14 His hands _are_ _as_ gold rings set with the beryl: his belly _is_ _as_ bright ivory overlaid _with_ sapphires. ^14

15 His legs _are_ _as_ pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance _is_ as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. ^15

16 His mouth _is_ most sweet: yea, he _is_ altogether lovely. This _is_ my beloved, and this _is_ my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. ^16
