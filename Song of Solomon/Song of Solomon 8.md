### Song of Solomon 8

1 O THAT thou _wert_ as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! _when_ I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised. ^1

2 I would lead thee, _and_ bring thee into my mother's house, _who_ would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. ^2

3 His left hand _should_ _be_ under my head, and his right hand should embrace me. ^3

4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake _my_ love, until he please. ^4

5 Who _is_ this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth _that_ bare thee. ^5

6 ¶ Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love _is_ strong as death; jealousy _is_ cruel as the grave: the coals thereof _are_ coals of fire, _which_ _hath_ a most vehement flame. ^6

7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned. ^7

8 ¶ We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? ^8

9 If she _be_ a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she _be_ a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. ^9

10 I _am_ a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. ^10

11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand _pieces_ of silver. ^11

12 My vineyard, which _is_ mine, _is_ before me: thou, O Solomon, _must_ _have_ a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. ^12

13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear _it_. ^13

14 ¶ Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices. ^14
