### Song of Solomon 2

1 I _AM_ the rose of Sharon, _and_ the lily of the valleys. ^1

2 As the lily among thorns, so _is_ my love among the daughters. ^2

3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so _is_ my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit _was_ sweet to my taste. ^3

4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me _was_ love. ^4

5 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I _am_ sick of love. ^5

6 His left hand _is_ under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. ^6

7 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake _my_ love, till he please. ^7

8 ¶ The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. ^8

9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. ^9

10 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. ^10

11 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over _and_ gone; ^11

12 The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing _of_ _birds_ is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; ^12

13 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines _with_ the tender grape give a _good_ smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. ^13

14 ¶ O my dove, _that_ _art_ in the clefts of the rock, in the secret _places_ of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet _is_ thy voice, and thy countenance _is_ comely. ^14

15 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines _have_ tender grapes. ^15

16 ¶ My beloved _is_ mine, and I _am_ his: he feedeth among the lilies. ^16

17 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. ^17
