### Song of Solomon 1

1 THE song of songs, which _is_ Solomon's. ^1

2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love _is_ better than wine. ^2

3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name _is_ _as_ ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. ^3

4 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee. ^4

5 I _am_ black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. ^5

6 Look not upon me, because I _am_ black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; _but_ mine own vineyard have I not kept. ^6

7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest _thy_ _flock_ to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? ^7

8 ¶ If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. ^8

9 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots. ^9

10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows _of_ _jewels_, thy neck with chains _of_ _gold_. ^10

11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. ^11

12 ¶ While the king _sitteth_ at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof. ^12

13 A bundle of myrrh _is_ my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. ^13

14 My beloved _is_ unto me _as_ a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi. ^14

15 Behold, thou _art_ fair, my love; behold, thou _art_ fair; thou _hast_ doves' eyes. ^15

16 Behold, thou _art_ fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed _is_ green. ^16

17 The beams of our house _are_ cedar, _and_ our rafters of fir. ^17
