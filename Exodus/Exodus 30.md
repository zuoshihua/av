### Exodus 30

1 AND thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: _of_ shittim wood shalt thou make it. ^1

2 A cubit _shall_ _be_ the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits _shall_ _be_ the height thereof: the horns thereof _shall_ _be_ of the same. ^2

3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. ^3

4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make _it;_ and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. ^4

5 And thou shalt make the staves _of_ shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. ^5

6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that _is_ by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that _is_ over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. ^6

7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. ^7

8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the $L{\small ORD}$ throughout your generations. ^8

9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. ^9

10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it _is_ most holy unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^11

12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the $L{\small ORD}$, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when _thou_ numberest them. ^12

13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel _is_ twenty gerahs:) an half shekel _shall_ _be_ the offering of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when _they_ give an offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$, to make an atonement for your souls. ^15

16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the $L{\small ORD}$, to make an atonement for your souls. ^16

17 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^17

18 Thou shalt also make a laver _of_ brass, and his foot _also_ _of_ brass, to wash _withal:_ and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. ^18

19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: ^19

20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$: ^20

21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, _even_ to him and to his seed throughout their generations. ^21

22 ¶ Moreover the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^22

23 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred _shekels_, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, _even_ two hundred and fifty _shekels_, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty _shekels_, ^23

24 And of cassia five hundred _shekels_, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: ^24

25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. ^25

26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, ^26

27 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, ^27

28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. ^28

29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. ^29

30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that _they_ may minister unto me in the priest's office. ^30

31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. ^31

32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make _any_ _other_ like it, after the composition of it: it _is_ holy, _and_ it shall be holy unto you. ^32

33 Whosoever compoundeth _any_ like it, or whosoever putteth _any_ of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. ^33

34 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; _these_ sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like _weight:_ ^34

35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure _and_ holy: ^35

36 And thou shalt beat _some_ of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. ^36

37 And _as_ _for_ the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the $L{\small ORD}$. ^37

38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people. ^38
