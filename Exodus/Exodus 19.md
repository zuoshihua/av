### Exodus 19

1 IN the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they _into_ the wilderness of Sinai. ^1

2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come _to_ the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. ^2

3 And Moses went up unto God, and the $L{\small ORD}$ called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; ^3

4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and _how_ I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. ^4

5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth _is_ mine: ^5

6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These _are_ the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. ^6

7 ¶ And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded him. ^7

8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, ^10

11 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the $L{\small ORD}$ will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. ^11

12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, _that_ _ye_ go _not_ up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: ^12

13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether _it_ _be_ beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. ^13

14 ¶ And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. ^14

15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at _your_ wives. ^15

16 ¶ And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that _was_ in the camp trembled. ^16

17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. ^17

18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the $L{\small ORD}$ descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. ^18

19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. ^19

20 And the $L{\small ORD}$ came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the $L{\small ORD}$ called Moses _up_ to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. ^20

21 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the $L{\small ORD}$ to gaze, and many of them perish. ^21

22 And let the priests also, which come near to the $L{\small ORD}$, sanctify themselves, lest the $L{\small ORD}$ break forth upon them. ^22

23 And Moses said unto the $L{\small ORD}$, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. ^23

24 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the $L{\small ORD}$, lest he break forth upon them. ^24

25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. ^25
