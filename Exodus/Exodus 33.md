### Exodus 33

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Depart, _and_ go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: ^1

2 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: ^2

3 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou _art_ a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. ^3

4 ¶ And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. ^4

5 For the $L{\small ORD}$ had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye _are_ a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. ^5

6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. ^6

7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, _that_ every one which sought the $L{\small ORD}$ went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which _was_ without the camp. ^7

8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, _that_ all the people rose up, and stood every man _at_ his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. ^8

9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood _at_ the door of the tabernacle, and _the_ _$L{\small ORD}$_ talked with Moses. ^9

10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand _at_ the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man _in_ his tent door. ^10

11 And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. ^11

12 ¶ And Moses said unto the $L{\small ORD}$, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. ^12

13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation _is_ thy people. ^13

14 And he said, My presence shall go _with_ _thee_, and I will give thee rest. ^14

15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not _with_ _me_, carry us not up hence. ^15

16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? _is_ _it_ not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that _are_ upon the face of the earth. ^16

17 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. ^17

18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. ^18

19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. ^19

20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. ^20

21 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said, Behold, _there_ _is_ a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: ^21

22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: ^22

23 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. ^23
