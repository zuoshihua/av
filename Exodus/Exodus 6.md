### Exodus 6

1 THEN the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. ^1

2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$: ^2

3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by _the_ _name_ _of_ God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. ^3

4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. ^4

5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. ^5

6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: ^6

7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. ^7

8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 ¶ And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. ^9

10 And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^10

11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. ^11

12 And Moses spake before the $L{\small ORD}$, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who _am_ of uncircumcised lips? ^12

13 And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. ^13

14 ¶ These _be_ the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these _be_ the families of Reuben. ^14

15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these _are_ the families of Simeon. ^15

16 ¶ And these _are_ the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi _were_ an hundred thirty and seven years. ^16

17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. ^17

18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath _were_ an hundred thirty and three years. ^18

19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these _are_ the families of Levi according to their generations. ^19

20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram _were_ an hundred and thirty and seven years. ^20

21 ¶ And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. ^21

22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. ^22

23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. ^23

24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these _are_ the families of the Korhites. ^24

25 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him _one_ of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these _are_ the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families. ^25

26 These _are_ that Aaron and Moses, to whom the $L{\small ORD}$ said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. ^26

27 These _are_ they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these _are_ that Moses and Aaron. ^27

28 ¶ And it came to pass on the day _when_ the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, ^28

29 That the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. ^29

30 And Moses said before the $L{\small ORD}$, Behold, I _am_ of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? ^30
