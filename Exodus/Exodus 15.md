### Exodus 15

1 THEN sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he _is_ my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ a man of war: the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ his name. ^3

4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. ^4

5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. ^5

6 Thy right hand, O $L{\small ORD}$, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O $L{\small ORD}$, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. ^6

7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, _which_ consumed them as stubble. ^7

8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, _and_ the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. ^8

9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. ^9

10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. ^10

11 Who _is_ like unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, among the gods? who _is_ like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful _in_ praises, doing wonders? ^11

12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. ^12

13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people _which_ thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided _them_ in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. ^13

14 The people shall hear, _and_ be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. ^14

15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. ^15

16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be _as_ still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O $L{\small ORD}$, till the people pass over, _which_ thou hast purchased. ^16

17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, _in_ the place, O $L{\small ORD}$, _which_ thou hast made for thee to dwell in, _in_ the Sanctuary, O Lord, _which_ thy hands have established. ^17

18 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall reign for ever and ever. ^18

19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the $L{\small ORD}$ brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry _land_ in the midst of the sea. ^19

20 ¶ And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. ^20

21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the $L{\small ORD}$, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. ^21

22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. ^22

23 ¶ And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they _were_ bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. ^23

24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? ^24

25 And he cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$; and the $L{\small ORD}$ shewed him a tree, _which_ when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, ^25

26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ that healeth thee. ^26

27 ¶ And they came to Elim, where _were_ twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters. ^27
