### Exodus 20

1 AND God spake all these words, saying, ^1

2 I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. ^2

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. ^3

4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness _of_ _any_ _thing_ that _is_ in heaven above, or that _is_ in the earth beneath, or that _is_ in the water under the earth: ^4

5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God _am_ a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth _generation_ of them that hate me; ^5

6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. ^6

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God in vain; for the $L{\small ORD}$ will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. ^7

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. ^8

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: ^9

10 But the seventh day _is_ the sabbath of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God: _in_ _it_ thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that _is_ within thy gates: ^10

11 For _in_ six days the $L{\small ORD}$ made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them _is_, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the $L{\small ORD}$ blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. ^11

12 ¶ Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God giveth thee. ^12

13 Thou shalt not kill. ^13

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. ^14

15 Thou shalt not steal. ^15

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. ^16

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that _is_ thy neighbour's. ^17

18 ¶ And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw _it_, they removed, and stood afar off. ^18

19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. ^19

20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. ^20

21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God _was_. ^21

22 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. ^22

23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. ^23

24 ¶ An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. ^24

25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. ^25

26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon. ^26
