### Exodus 22

1 IF a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. ^1

2 ¶ If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, _there_ _shall_ no blood _be_ _shed_ for him. ^2

3 If the sun be risen upon him, _there_ _shall_ _be_ blood _shed_ for him; _for_ he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. ^3

4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double. ^4

5 ¶ If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution. ^5

6 ¶ If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed _therewith;_ he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. ^6

7 ¶ If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double. ^7

8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, _to_ _see_ whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods. ^8

9 For all manner of trespass, _whether_ _it_ _be_ for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, _or_ for any manner of lost thing, which _another_ challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; _and_ whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour. ^9

10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing _it:_ ^10

11 _Then_ shall an oath of the $L{\small ORD}$ be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept _thereof_, and he shall not make _it_ good. ^11

12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. ^12

13 If it be torn in pieces, _then_ let him bring it _for_ witness, _and_ he shall not make good that which was torn. ^13

14 ¶ And if a man borrow _ought_ of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof _being_ not with it, he shall surely make _it_ good. ^14

15 _But_ if the owner thereof _be_ with it, he shall not make _it_ good: if it _be_ an hired _thing_, it came for his hire. ^15

16 ¶ And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. ^16

17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. ^17

18 ¶ Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. ^18

19 ¶ Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. ^19

20 ¶ He that sacrificeth unto _any_ god, save unto the $L{\small ORD}$ only, he shall be utterly destroyed. ^20

21 ¶ Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. ^21

22 ¶ Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. ^22

23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; ^23

24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. ^24

25 ¶ If thou lend money to _any_ _of_ my people _that_ _is_ poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury. ^25

26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: ^26

27 For that _is_ his covering only, it _is_ his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I _am_ gracious. ^27

28 ¶ Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people. ^28

29 ¶ Thou shalt not delay _to_ _offer_ the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. ^29

30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, _and_ with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me. ^30

31 ¶ And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat _any_ flesh _that_ _is_ torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs. ^31
