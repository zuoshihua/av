### Exodus 2

1 AND there went a man of the house of Levi, and took _to_ _wife_ a daughter of Levi. ^1

2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he _was_ _a_ goodly _child_, she hid him three months. ^2

3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid _it_ in the flags by the river's brink. ^3

4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. ^4

5 ¶ And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash _herself_ at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. ^5

6 And when she had opened _it_, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This _is_ _one_ of the Hebrews' children. ^6

7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? ^7

8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. ^8

9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give _thee_ thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. ^9

10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. ^10

11 ¶ And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. ^11

12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that _there_ _was_ no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. ^12

13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? ^13

14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. ^14

15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. ^15

16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew _water_, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. ^16

17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. ^17

18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How _is_ _it_ _that_ ye are come so soon to day? ^18

19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew _water_ enough for us, and watered the flock. ^19

20 And he said unto his daughters, And where _is_ he? why _is_ it _that_ ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. ^20

21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. ^21

22 And she bare _him_ a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. ^22

23 ¶ And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. ^23

24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. ^24

25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto _them_. ^25
