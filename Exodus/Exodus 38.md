### Exodus 38

1 AND he made the altar of burnt offering _of_ shittim wood: five cubits _was_ the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; _it_ _was_ foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof. ^1

2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass. ^2

3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, _and_ the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he _of_ brass. ^3

4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it. ^4

5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, _to_ _be_ places for the staves. ^5

6 And he made the staves _of_ shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass. ^6

7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards. ^7

8 ¶ And he made the laver _of_ brass, and the foot of it _of_ brass, of the lookingglasses of _the_ _women_ assembling, which assembled _at_ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. ^8

9 ¶ And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court _were_ _of_ fine twined linen, an hundred cubits: ^9

10 Their pillars _were_ twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets _were_ _of_ silver. ^10

11 And for the north side _the_ _hangings_ _were_ an hundred cubits, their pillars _were_ twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets _of_ silver. ^11

12 And for the west side _were_ hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets _of_ silver. ^12

13 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. ^13

14 The hangings of the one side _of_ _the_ _gate_ _were_ fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. ^14

15 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, _were_ hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. ^15

16 All the hangings of the court round about _were_ of fine twined linen. ^16

17 And the sockets for the pillars _were_ _of_ brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets _of_ silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters _of_ silver; and all the pillars of the court _were_ filleted with silver. ^17

18 And the hanging for the gate of the court _was_ needlework, _of_ blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits _was_ the length, and the height in the breadth _was_ five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. ^18

19 And their pillars _were_ four, and their sockets _of_ brass four; their hooks _of_ silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets _of_ silver. ^19

20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, _were_ _of_ brass. ^20

21 ¶ This is the sum of the tabernacle, _even_ of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, _for_ the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. ^21

22 And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses. ^22

23 And with him _was_ Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. ^23

24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy _place_, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. ^24

25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation _was_ an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: ^25

26 A bekah for every man, _that_ _is_, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty _men_. ^26

27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. ^27

28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five _shekels_ he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them. ^28

29 And the brass of the offering _was_ seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. ^29

30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar, ^30

31 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about. ^31
