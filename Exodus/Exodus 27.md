### Exodus 27

1 AND thou shalt make an altar _of_ shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof _shall_ _be_ three cubits. ^1

2 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. ^2

3 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make _of_ brass. ^3

4 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network _of_ brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof. ^4

5 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar. ^5

6 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves _of_ shittim wood, and overlay them with brass. ^6

7 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it. ^7

8 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make _it_. ^8

9 ¶ And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward _there_ _shall_ _be_ hangings for the court _of_ fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side: ^9

10 And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets _shall_ _be_ _of_ brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets _shall_ _be_ _of_ silver. ^10

11 And likewise for the north side in length _there_ _shall_ _be_ hangings of an hundred _cubits_ long, and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets _of_ brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets _of_ silver. ^11

12 ¶ And _for_ the breadth of the court on the west side _shall_ _be_ hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten. ^12

13 And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward _shall_ _be_ fifty cubits. ^13

14 The hangings of one side _of_ _the_ _gate_ _shall_ _be_ fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three. ^14

15 And on the other side _shall_ _be_ hangings fifteen _cubits:_ their pillars three, and their sockets three. ^15

16 ¶ And for the gate of the court _shall_ _be_ an hanging of twenty cubits, _of_ blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: _and_ their pillars _shall_ _be_ four, and their sockets four. ^16

17 All the pillars round about the court _shall_ _be_ filleted with silver; their hooks _shall_ _be_ _of_ silver, and their sockets _of_ brass. ^17

18 ¶ The length of the court _shall_ _be_ an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits _of_ fine twined linen, and their sockets _of_ brass. ^18

19 All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, _shall_ _be_ _of_ brass. ^19

20 ¶ And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always. ^20

21 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which _is_ before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the $L{\small ORD}$: _it_ _shall_ _be_ a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel. ^21
