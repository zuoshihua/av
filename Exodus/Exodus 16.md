### Exodus 16

1 AND they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which _is_ between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. ^1

2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: ^2

3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, _and_ when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. ^3

4 ¶ Then said the $L{\small ORD}$ unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. ^4

5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare _that_ which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. ^5

6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: ^6

7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$; for that he heareth your murmurings against the $L{\small ORD}$: and what _are_ we, that ye murmur against us? ^7

8 And Moses said, _This_ _shall_ _be_, when the $L{\small ORD}$ shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the $L{\small ORD}$ heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what _are_ we? your murmurings _are_ not against us, but against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 ¶ And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the $L{\small ORD}$: for he hath heard your murmurings. ^9

10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ appeared in the cloud. ^10

11 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^11

12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^12

13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. ^13

14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness _there_ _lay_ a small round thing, _as_ small as the hoar frost on the ground. ^14

15 And when the children of Israel saw _it_, they said one to another, It _is_ manna: for they wist not what it _was_. And Moses said unto them, This _is_ the bread which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath given you to eat. ^15

16 ¶ This _is_ the thing which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, _according_ _to_ the number of your persons; take ye every man for _them_ which _are_ in his tents. ^16

17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. ^17

18 And when they did mete _it_ with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. ^18

19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. ^19

20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. ^20

21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. ^21

22 ¶ And it came to pass, _that_ on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one _man:_ and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. ^22

23 And he said unto them, This _is_ _that_ which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath said, To morrow _is_ the rest of the holy sabbath unto the $L{\small ORD}$: bake _that_ which ye will bake _to_ _day_, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. ^23

24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. ^24

25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day _is_ a sabbath unto the $L{\small ORD}$: to day ye shall not find it in the field. ^25

26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, _which_ _is_ the sabbath, in it there shall be none. ^26

27 ¶ And it came to pass, _that_ there went out _some_ of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. ^27

28 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? ^28

29 See, for that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. ^29

30 So the people rested on the seventh day. ^30

31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it _was_ like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it _was_ like wafers _made_ with honey. ^31

32 ¶ And Moses said, This _is_ the thing which the $L{\small ORD}$ commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. ^32

33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the $L{\small ORD}$, to be kept for your generations. ^33

34 As the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. ^34

35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. ^35

36 Now an omer _is_ the tenth _part_ of an ephah. ^36
