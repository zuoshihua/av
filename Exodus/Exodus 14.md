### Exodus 14

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. ^2

3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They _are_ entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. ^3

4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. And they did so. ^4

5 ¶ And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? ^5

6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: ^6

7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. ^7

8 And the $L{\small ORD}$ hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. ^8

9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses _and_ chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon. ^9

10 ¶ And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 And they said unto Moses, Because _there_ _were_ no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? ^11

12 _Is_ not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For _it_ _had_ _been_ better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. ^12

13 ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the $L{\small ORD}$, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. ^13

14 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. ^14

15 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: ^15

16 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry _ground_ through the midst of the sea. ^16

17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. ^17

18 And the Egyptians shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. ^18

19 ¶ And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: ^19

20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness _to_ _them_, but it gave light by night _to_ _these:_ so that the one came not near the other all the night. ^20

21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the $L{\small ORD}$ caused the sea to go _back_ by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry _land_, and the waters were divided. ^21

22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry _ground:_ and the waters _were_ a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. ^22

23 ¶ And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, _even_ all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. ^23

24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the $L{\small ORD}$ looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, ^24

25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the $L{\small ORD}$ fighteth for them against the Egyptians. ^25

26 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. ^26

27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the $L{\small ORD}$ overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. ^27

28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, _and_ all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. ^28

29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry _land_ in the midst of the sea; and the waters _were_ a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. ^29

30 Thus the $L{\small ORD}$ saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. ^30

31 And Israel saw that great work which the $L{\small ORD}$ did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the $L{\small ORD}$, and believed the $L{\small ORD}$, and his servant Moses. ^31
