### Exodus 5

1 AND afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. ^1

2 And Pharaoh said, Who _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the $L{\small ORD}$, neither will I let Israel go. ^2

3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the $L{\small ORD}$ our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. ^3

4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. ^4

5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now _are_ many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. ^5

6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, ^6

7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. ^7

8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish _ought_ thereof: for they _be_ idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go _and_ sacrifice to our God. ^8

9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. ^9

10 ¶ And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. ^10

11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. ^11

12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. ^12

13 And the taskmasters hasted _them_, saying, Fulfil your works, _your_ daily tasks, as when there was straw. ^13

14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, _and_ demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? ^14

15 ¶ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? ^15

16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants _are_ beaten; but the fault _is_ in thine own people. ^16

17 But he said, Ye _are_ idle, _ye_ _are_ idle: therefore ye say, Let us go _and_ do sacrifice to the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 Go therefore now, _and_ work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. ^18

19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see _that_ they _were_ in evil _case_, after it was said, Ye shall not minish _ought_ from your bricks of your daily task. ^19

20 ¶ And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: ^20

21 And they said unto them, The $L{\small ORD}$ look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. ^21

22 And Moses returned unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou _so_ evil entreated this people? why _is_ it _that_ thou hast sent me? ^22

23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. ^23
