### Exodus 24

1 AND he said unto Moses, Come up unto the $L{\small ORD}$, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. ^1

2 And Moses alone shall come near the $L{\small ORD}$: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him. ^2

3 ¶ And Moses came and told the people all the words of the $L{\small ORD}$, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath said will we do. ^3

4 And Moses wrote all the words of the $L{\small ORD}$, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. ^4

5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put _it_ in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. ^6

7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath said will we do, and be obedient. ^7

8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled _it_ on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath made with you concerning all these words. ^8

9 ¶ Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel: ^9

10 And they saw the God of Israel: and _there_ _was_ under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in _his_ clearness. ^10

11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink. ^11

12 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. ^12

13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God. ^13

14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur _are_ with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. ^14

15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. ^15

16 And the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. ^16

17 And the sight of the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ _was_ like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. ^17

18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights. ^18
