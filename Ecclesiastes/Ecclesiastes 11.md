### Ecclesiastes 11

1 CAST thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. ^1

2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. ^2

3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty _themselves_ upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. ^3

4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. ^4

5 As thou knowest not what _is_ the way of the spirit, _nor_ how the bones _do_ _grow_ in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. ^5

6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both _shall_ _be_ alike good. ^6

7 ¶ Truly the light _is_ sweet, and a pleasant _thing_ _it_ _is_ for the eyes to behold the sun: ^7

8 But if a man live many years, _and_ rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh _is_ vanity. ^8

9 ¶ Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these _things_ God will bring thee into judgment. ^9

10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth _are_ vanity. ^10
