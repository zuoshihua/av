### Ecclesiastes 4

1 SO I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of _such_ _as_ _were_ oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors _there_ _was_ power; but they had no comforter. ^1

2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. ^2

3 Yea, better _is_ _he_ than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. ^3

4 ¶ Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This _is_ also vanity and vexation of spirit. ^4

5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. ^5

6 Better _is_ an handful _with_ quietness, than both the hands full _with_ travail and vexation of spirit. ^6

7 ¶ Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. ^7

8 There is one _alone_, and _there_ _is_ not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet _is_ _there_ no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither _saith_ _he_, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This _is_ also vanity, yea, it _is_ a sore travail. ^8

9 ¶ Two _are_ better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. ^9

10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him _that_ _is_ alone when he falleth; for _he_ _hath_ not another to help him up. ^10

11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm _alone?_ ^11

12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. ^12

13 ¶ Better _is_ a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. ^13

14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also _he_ _that_ _is_ born in his kingdom becometh poor. ^14

15 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. ^15

16 _There_ _is_ no end of all the people, _even_ of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also _is_ vanity and vexation of spirit. ^16
