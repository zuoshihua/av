### Ecclesiastes 6

1 THERE is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it _is_ common among men: ^1

2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this _is_ vanity, and it _is_ an evil disease. ^2

3 ¶ If a man beget an hundred _children_, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also _that_ he have no burial; I say, _that_ an untimely birth _is_ better than he. ^3

4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness. ^4

5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known _any_ _thing:_ this hath more rest than the other. ^5

6 ¶ Yea, though he live a thousand years twice _told_, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? ^6

7 All the labour of man _is_ for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. ^7

8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? ^8

9 ¶ Better _is_ the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this _is_ also vanity and vexation of spirit. ^9

10 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it _is_ man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he. ^10

11 ¶ Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what _is_ man the better? ^11

12 For who knoweth what _is_ good for man in _this_ life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? ^12
