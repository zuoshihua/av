### Ecclesiastes 1

1 THE words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. ^1

2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all _is_ vanity. ^2

3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? ^3

4 _One_ generation passeth away, and _another_ generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. ^4

5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. ^5

6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. ^6

7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea _is_ not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. ^7

8 All things _are_ full of labour; man cannot utter _it:_ the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. ^8

9 The thing that hath been, it _is_ _that_ which shall be; and that which is done _is_ that which shall be done: and _there_ _is_ no new _thing_ under the sun. ^9

10 Is there _any_ thing whereof it may be said, See, this _is_ new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. ^10

11 _There_ _is_ no remembrance of former _things;_ neither shall there be _any_ remembrance of _things_ that are to come with _those_ that shall come after. ^11

12 Â¶ I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. ^12

13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all _things_ that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. ^13

14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all _is_ vanity and vexation of spirit. ^14

15 _That_ _which_ _is_ crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. ^15

16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all _they_ that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. ^16

17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. ^17

18 For in much wisdom _is_ much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. ^18
