### Ecclesiastes 3

1 TO every _thing_ _there_ _is_ a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: ^1

2 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up _that_ _which_ _is_ planted; ^2

3 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; ^3

4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; ^4

5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; ^5

6 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; ^6

7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; ^7

8 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. ^8

9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? ^9

10 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. ^10

11 He hath made every _thing_ beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. ^11

12 I know that _there_ _is_ no good in them, but for _a_ _man_ to rejoice, and to do good in his life. ^12

13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it _is_ the gift of God. ^13

14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth _it_, that _men_ should fear before him. ^14

15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. ^15

16 Â¶ And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, _that_ wickedness _was_ there; and the place of righteousness, _that_ iniquity _was_ there. ^16

17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for _there_ _is_ a time there for every purpose and for every work. ^17

18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. ^18

19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all _is_ vanity. ^19

20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. ^20

21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? ^21

22 Wherefore I perceive that _there_ _is_ nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that _is_ his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? ^22
