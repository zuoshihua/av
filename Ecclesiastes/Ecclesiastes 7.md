### Ecclesiastes 7

1 A GOOD name _is_ better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. ^1

2 ¶ _It_ _is_ better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that _is_ the end of all men; and the living will lay _it_ to his heart. ^2

3 Sorrow _is_ better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. ^3

4 The heart of the wise _is_ in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools _is_ in the house of mirth. ^4

5 _It_ _is_ better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. ^5

6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so _is_ the laughter of the fool: this also _is_ vanity. ^6

7 ¶ Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. ^7

8 Better _is_ the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: _and_ the patient in spirit _is_ better than the proud in spirit. ^8

9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. ^9

10 Say not thou, What is _the_ _cause_ that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this. ^10

11 ¶ Wisdom _is_ good with an inheritance: and _by_ _it_ _there_ _is_ profit to them that see the sun. ^11

12 For wisdom _is_ a defence, _and_ money _is_ a defence: but the excellency of knowledge _is_, _that_ wisdom giveth life to them that have it. ^12

13 Consider the work of God: for who can make _that_ straight, which he hath made crooked? ^13

14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. ^14

15 All _things_ have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just _man_ that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked _man_ that prolongeth _his_ _life_ in his wickedness. ^15

16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? ^16

17 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? ^17

18 _It_ _is_ good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. ^18

19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty _men_ which are in the city. ^19

20 For _there_ _is_ not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. ^20

21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: ^21

22 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. ^22

23 ¶ All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it _was_ far from me. ^23

24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? ^24

25 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason _of_ _things_, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness _and_ madness: ^25

26 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart _is_ snares and nets, _and_ her hands _as_ bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. ^26

27 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, _counting_ one by one, to find out the account: ^27

28 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. ^28

29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. ^29
