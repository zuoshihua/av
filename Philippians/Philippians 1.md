### Philippians 1

1 PAUL and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: ^1

2 Grace _be_ unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and _from_ the Lord Jesus Christ. ^2

3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, ^3

4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, ^4

5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; ^5

6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform _it_ until the day of Jesus Christ: ^6

7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. ^7

8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. ^8

9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and _in_ all judgment; ^9

10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; ^10

11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. ^11

12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things _which_ _happened_ unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; ^12

13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other _places;_ ^13

14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. ^14

15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: ^15

16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: ^16

17 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. ^17

18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. ^18

19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, ^19

20 According to my earnest expectation and _my_ hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but _that_ with all boldness, as always, _so_ now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether _it_ _be_ by life, or by death. ^20

21 For to me to live _is_ Christ, and to die _is_ gain. ^21

22 But if I live in the flesh, this _is_ the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. ^22

23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: ^23

24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh _is_ more needful for you. ^24

25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; ^25

26 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. ^26

27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; ^27

28 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. ^28

29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; ^29

30 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear _to_ _be_ in me. ^30
