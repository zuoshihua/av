### Philippians 4

1 THEREFORE, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, _my_ dearly beloved. ^1

2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. ^2

3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and _with_ other my fellowlabourers, whose names _are_ in the book of life. ^3

4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: _and_ again I say, Rejoice. ^4

5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord _is_ at hand. ^5

6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. ^6

7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. ^7

8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things _are_ honest, whatsoever things _are_ just, whatsoever things _are_ pure, whatsoever things _are_ lovely, whatsoever things _are_ of good report; if _there_ _be_ any virtue, and if _there_ _be_ any praise, think on these things. ^8

9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. ^9

10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. ^10

11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, _therewith_ to be content. ^11

12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. ^12

13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. ^13

14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. ^14

15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. ^15

16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. ^16

17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. ^17

18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things _which_ _were_ _sent_ from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. ^18

19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. ^19

20 Now unto God and our Father _be_ glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^20

21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. ^21

22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Cæsar's household. ^22

23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you all. Amen. ^23

> ¶     It was written to _the_ Philippians from Rome by Epaphroditus.
