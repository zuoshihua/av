### Proverbs 14

1 EVERY wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. ^1

2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the $L{\small ORD}$: but _he_ _that_ _is_ perverse in his ways despiseth him. ^2

3 In the mouth of the foolish _is_ a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. ^3

4 Where no oxen _are_, the crib _is_ clean: but much increase _is_ by the strength of the ox. ^4

5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. ^5

6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and _findeth_ _it_ not: but knowledge _is_ easy unto him that understandeth. ^6

7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not _in_ _him_ the lips of knowledge. ^7

8 The wisdom of the prudent _is_ to understand his way: but the folly of fools _is_ deceit. ^8

9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous _there_ _is_ favour. ^9

10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. ^10

11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. ^11

12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof _are_ the ways of death. ^12

13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth _is_ heaviness. ^13

14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man _shall_ _be_ _satisfied_ from himself. ^14

15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent _man_ looketh well to his going. ^15

16 A wise _man_ feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident. ^16

17 _He_ _that_ _is_ soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. ^17

18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. ^18

19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. ^19

20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich _hath_ many friends. ^20

21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy _is_ he. ^21

22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth _shall_ _be_ to them that devise good. ^22

23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips _tendeth_ only to penury. ^23

24 The crown of the wise _is_ their riches: _but_ the foolishness of fools _is_ folly. ^24

25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful _witness_ speaketh lies. ^25

26 In the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. ^26

27 The fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. ^27

28 In the multitude of people _is_ the king's honour: but in the want of people _is_ the destruction of the prince. ^28

29 _He_ _that_ _is_ slow to wrath _is_ of great understanding: but _he_ _that_ _is_ hasty of spirit exalteth folly. ^29

30 A sound heart _is_ the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. ^30

31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. ^31

32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. ^32

33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but _that_ _which_ _is_ in the midst of fools is made known. ^33

34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin _is_ a reproach to any people. ^34

35 The king's favour _is_ toward a wise servant: but his wrath is _against_ him that causeth shame. ^35
