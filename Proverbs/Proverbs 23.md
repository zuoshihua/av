### Proverbs 23

1 WHEN thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what _is_ before thee: ^1

2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou _be_ a man given to appetite. ^2

3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they _are_ deceitful meat. ^3

4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. ^4

5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for _riches_ certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. ^5

6 Eat thou not the bread of _him_ _that_ _hath_ an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: ^6

7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart _is_ not with thee. ^7

8 The morsel _which_ thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. ^8

9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. ^9

10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: ^10

11 For their redeemer _is_ mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee. ^11

12 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. ^12

13 Withhold not correction from the child: for _if_ thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. ^13

14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. ^14

15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. ^15

16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. ^16

17 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but _be_ _thou_ in the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ all the day long. ^17

18 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. ^18

19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. ^19

20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: ^20

21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe _a_ _man_ with rags. ^21

22 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. ^22

23 Buy the truth, and sell _it_ not; _also_ wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. ^23

24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise _child_ shall have joy of him. ^24

25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. ^25

26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. ^26

27 For a whore _is_ a deep ditch; and a strange woman _is_ a narrow pit. ^27

28 She also lieth in wait as _for_ a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. ^28

29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? ^29

30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. ^30

31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, _when_ it moveth itself aright. ^31

32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. ^32

33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. ^33

34 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. ^34

35 They have stricken me, _shalt_ _thou_ _say_, _and_ I was not sick; they have beaten me, _and_ I felt _it_ not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. ^35
