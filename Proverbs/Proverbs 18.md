### Proverbs 18

1 THROUGH desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh _and_ intermeddleth with all wisdom. ^1

2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. ^2

3 When the wicked cometh, _then_ cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. ^3

4 The words of a man's mouth _are_ _as_ deep waters, _and_ the wellspring of wisdom _as_ a flowing brook. ^4

5 _It_ _is_ not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. ^5

6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. ^6

7 A fool's mouth _is_ his destruction, and his lips _are_ the snare of his soul. ^7

8 The words of a talebearer _are_ as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. ^8

9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster. ^9

10 The name of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. ^10

11 The rich man's wealth _is_ his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. ^11

12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour _is_ humility. ^12

13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth _it_, it _is_ folly and shame unto him. ^13

14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? ^14

15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. ^15

16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. ^16

17 _He_ _that_ _is_ first in his own cause _seemeth_ just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. ^17

18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. ^18

19 A brother offended _is_ _harder_ _to_ _be_ _won_ than a strong city: and _their_ contentions _are_ like the bars of a castle. ^19

20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; _and_ with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. ^20

21 Death and life _are_ in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. ^21

22 _Whoso_ findeth a wife findeth a good _thing_, and obtaineth favour of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^22

23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. ^23

24 A man _that_ _hath_ friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend _that_ sticketh closer than a brother. ^24
