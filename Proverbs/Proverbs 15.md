### Proverbs 15

1 A SOFT answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger. ^1

2 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness. ^2

3 The eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ in every place, beholding the evil and the good. ^3

4 A wholesome tongue _is_ a tree of life: but perverseness therein _is_ a breach in the spirit. ^4

5 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. ^5

6 In the house of the righteous _is_ much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. ^6

7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish _doeth_ not so. ^7

8 The sacrifice of the wicked _is_ an abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$: but the prayer of the upright _is_ his delight. ^8

9 The way of the wicked _is_ an abomination unto the $L{\small ORD}$: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. ^9

10 Correction _is_ grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: _and_ he that hateth reproof shall die. ^10

11 Hell and destruction _are_ before the $L{\small ORD}$: how much more then the hearts of the children of men? ^11

12 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise. ^12

13 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. ^13

14 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness. ^14

15 All the days of the afflicted _are_ evil: but he that is of a merry heart _hath_ a continual feast. ^15

16 Better _is_ little with the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ than great treasure and trouble therewith. ^16

17 Better _is_ a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. ^17

18 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but _he_ _that_ _is_ slow to anger appeaseth strife. ^18

19 The way of the slothful _man_ _is_ as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous _is_ made plain. ^19

20 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. ^20

21 Folly _is_ joy to _him_ _that_ _is_ destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly. ^21

22 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellers they are established. ^22

23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word _spoken_ in due season, how good _is_ _it!_ ^23

24 The way of life _is_ above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath. ^24

25 The $L{\small ORD}$ will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow. ^25

26 The thoughts of the wicked _are_ an abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$: but _the_ _words_ of the pure _are_ pleasant words. ^26

27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live. ^27

28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. ^28

29 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. ^29

30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: _and_ a good report maketh the bones fat. ^30

31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. ^31

32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding. ^32

33 The fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ the instruction of wisdom; and before honour _is_ humility. ^33
