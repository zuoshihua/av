### Proverbs 10

1 THE proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son _is_ the heaviness of his mother. ^1

2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. ^3

4 He becometh poor that dealeth _with_ a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. ^4

5 He that gathereth in summer _is_ a wise son: _but_ he that sleepeth in harvest _is_ a son that causeth shame. ^5

6 Blessings _are_ upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. ^6

7 The memory of the just _is_ blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot. ^7

8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. ^8

9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. ^9

10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. ^10

11 The mouth of a righteous _man_ _is_ a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. ^11

12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. ^12

13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod _is_ for the back of him that is void of understanding. ^13

14 Wise _men_ lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish _is_ near destruction. ^14

15 The rich man's wealth _is_ his strong city: the destruction of the poor _is_ their poverty. ^15

16 The labour of the righteous _tendeth_ to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. ^16

17 He _is_ _in_ the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth. ^17

18 He that hideth hatred _with_ lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, _is_ a fool. ^18

19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips _is_ wise. ^19

20 The tongue of the just _is_ _as_ choice silver: the heart of the wicked _is_ little worth. ^20

21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom. ^21

22 The blessing of the $L{\small ORD}$, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. ^22

23 _It_ _is_ as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. ^23

24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. ^24

25 As the whirlwind passeth, so _is_ the wicked no _more:_ but the righteous _is_ an everlasting foundation. ^25

26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so _is_ the sluggard to them that send him. ^26

27 The fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. ^27

28 The hope of the righteous _shall_ _be_ gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. ^28

29 The way of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ strength to the upright: but destruction _shall_ _be_ to the workers of iniquity. ^29

30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. ^30

31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. ^31

32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked _speaketh_ frowardness. ^32
