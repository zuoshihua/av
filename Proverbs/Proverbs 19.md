### Proverbs 19

1 BETTER _is_ the poor that walketh in his integrity, than _he_ _that_ _is_ perverse in his lips, and is a fool. ^1

2 Also, _that_ the soul _be_ without knowledge, _it_ _is_ not good; and he that hasteth with _his_ feet sinneth. ^2

3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. ^4

5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and _he_ _that_ speaketh lies shall not escape. ^5

6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man _is_ a friend to him that giveth gifts. ^6

7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth _them_ _with_ words, _yet_ they _are_ wanting _to_ _him_. ^7

8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. ^8

9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and _he_ _that_ speaketh lies shall perish. ^9

10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. ^10

11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and _it_ _is_ his glory to pass over a transgression. ^11

12 The king's wrath _is_ as the roaring of a lion; but his favour _is_ as dew upon the grass. ^12

13 A foolish son _is_ the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife _are_ a continual dropping. ^13

14 House and riches _are_ the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife _is_ from the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. ^15

16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; _but_ he that despiseth his ways shall die. ^16

17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the $L{\small ORD}$; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. ^17

18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. ^18

19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver _him_, yet thou must do it again. ^19

20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. ^20

21 _There_ _are_ many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the $L{\small ORD}$, that shall stand. ^21

22 The desire of a man _is_ his kindness: and a poor man _is_ better than a liar. ^22

23 The fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _tendeth_ to life: and _he_ _that_ _hath_ _it_ shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. ^23

24 A slothful _man_ hideth his hand in _his_ bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. ^24

25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, _and_ he will understand knowledge. ^25

26 He that wasteth _his_ father, _and_ chaseth away _his_ mother, _is_ a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. ^26

27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction _that_ _causeth_ to err from the words of knowledge. ^27

28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. ^28

29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools. ^29
