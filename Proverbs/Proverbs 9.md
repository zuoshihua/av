### Proverbs 9

1 WISDOM hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: ^1

2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. ^2

3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, ^3

4 Whoso _is_ simple, let him turn in hither: _as_ _for_ him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ^4

5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine _which_ I have mingled. ^5

6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. ^6

7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked _man_ _getteth_ himself a blot. ^7

8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. ^8

9 Give _instruction_ to a wise _man_, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just _man_, and he will increase in learning. ^9

10 The fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy _is_ understanding. ^10

11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. ^11

12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but _if_ thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear _it_. ^12

13 Â¶ A foolish woman _is_ clamorous: _she_ _is_ simple, and knoweth nothing. ^13

14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, ^14

15 To call passengers who go right on their ways: ^15

16 Whoso _is_ simple, let him turn in hither: and _as_ _for_ him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ^16

17 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread _eaten_ in secret is pleasant. ^17

18 But he knoweth not that the dead _are_ there; _and_ _that_ her guests _are_ in the depths of hell. ^18
