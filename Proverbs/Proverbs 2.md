### Proverbs 2

1 MY son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; ^1

2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, _and_ apply thine heart to understanding; ^2

3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, _and_ liftest up thy voice for understanding; ^3

4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as _for_ hid treasures; ^4

5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$, and find the knowledge of God. ^5

6 For the $L{\small ORD}$ giveth wisdom: out of his mouth _cometh_ knowledge and understanding. ^6

7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: _he_ _is_ a buckler to them that walk uprightly. ^7

8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. ^8

9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; _yea_, every good path. ^9

10 Â¶ When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; ^10

11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: ^11

12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil _man_, from the man that speaketh froward things; ^12

13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; ^13

14 Who rejoice to do evil, _and_ delight in the frowardness of the wicked; ^14

15 Whose ways _are_ crooked, and _they_ froward in their paths: ^15

16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, _even_ from the stranger _which_ flattereth with her words; ^16

17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. ^17

18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. ^18

19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. ^19

20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good _men_, and keep the paths of the righteous. ^20

21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. ^21

22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. ^22
