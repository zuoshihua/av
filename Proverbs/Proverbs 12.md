### Proverbs 12

1 WHOSO loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof _is_ brutish. ^1

2 A good _man_ obtaineth favour of the $L{\small ORD}$: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. ^2

3 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. ^3

4 A virtuous woman _is_ a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed _is_ as rottenness in his bones. ^4

5 The thoughts of the righteous _are_ right: _but_ the counsels of the wicked _are_ deceit. ^5

6 The words of the wicked _are_ to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. ^6

7 The wicked are overthrown, and _are_ not: but the house of the righteous shall stand. ^7

8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. ^8

9 _He_ _that_ _is_ despised, and hath a servant, _is_ better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread. ^9

10 A righteous _man_ regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked _are_ cruel. ^10

11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain _persons_ _is_ void of understanding. ^11

12 The wicked desireth the net of evil _men:_ but the root of the righteous yieldeth _fruit_. ^12

13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of _his_ lips: but the just shall come out of trouble. ^13

14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of _his_ mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. ^14

15 The way of a fool _is_ right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel _is_ wise. ^15

16 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent _man_ covereth shame. ^16

17 _He_ _that_ speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit. ^17

18 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise _is_ health. ^18

19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue _is_ but for a moment. ^19

20 Deceit _is_ in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellers of peace _is_ joy. ^20

21 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. ^21

22 Lying lips _are_ abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$: but they that deal truly _are_ his delight. ^22

23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. ^23

24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute. ^24

25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad. ^25

26 The righteous _is_ more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them. ^26

27 The slothful _man_ roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man _is_ precious. ^27

28 In the way of righteousness _is_ life; and _in_ the pathway _thereof_ _there_ _is_ no death. ^28
