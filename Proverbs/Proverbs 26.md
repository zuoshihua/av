### Proverbs 26

1 AS snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. ^1

2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. ^2

3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. ^3

4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. ^4

5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. ^5

6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, _and_ drinketh damage. ^6

7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so _is_ a parable in the mouth of fools. ^7

8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so _is_ he that giveth honour to a fool. ^8

9 _As_ a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so _is_ a parable in the mouth of fools. ^9

10 The great _God_ that formed all _things_ both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. ^10

11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, _so_ a fool returneth to his folly. ^11

12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? _there_ _is_ more hope of a fool than of him. ^12

13 The slothful _man_ saith, _There_ _is_ a lion in the way; a lion _is_ in the streets. ^13

14 _As_ the door turneth upon his hinges, so _doth_ the slothful upon his bed. ^14

15 The slothful hideth his hand in _his_ bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. ^15

16 The sluggard _is_ wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. ^16

17 He that passeth by, _and_ meddleth with strife _belonging_ not to him, _is_ _like_ one that taketh a dog by the ears. ^17

18 As a mad _man_ who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, ^18

19 So _is_ the man _that_ deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? ^19

20 Where no wood is, _there_ the fire goeth out: so where _there_ _is_ no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. ^20

21 _As_ coals _are_ to burning coals, and wood to fire; so _is_ a contentious man to kindle strife. ^21

22 The words of a talebearer _are_ as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. ^22

23 Burning lips and a wicked heart _are_ _like_ a potsherd covered with silver dross. ^23

24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; ^24

25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for _there_ _are_ seven abominations in his heart. ^25

26 _Whose_ hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the _whole_ congregation. ^26

27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. ^27

28 A lying tongue hateth _those_ _that_ _are_ afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. ^28
