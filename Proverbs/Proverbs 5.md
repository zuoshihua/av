### Proverbs 5

1 MY son, attend unto my wisdom, _and_ bow thine ear to my understanding: ^1

2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and _that_ thy lips may keep knowledge. ^2

3 ¶ For the lips of a strange woman drop _as_ an honeycomb, and her mouth _is_ smoother than oil: ^3

4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. ^4

5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. ^5

6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, _that_ thou canst not know _them_. ^6

7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. ^7

8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: ^8

9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: ^9

10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours _be_ in the house of a stranger; ^10

11 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, ^11

12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; ^12

13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! ^13

14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. ^14

15 ¶ Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. ^15

16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, _and_ rivers of waters in the streets. ^16

17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. ^17

18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. ^18

19 _Let_ _her_ _be_ _as_ the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. ^19

20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? ^20

21 For the ways of man _are_ before the eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$, and he pondereth all his goings. ^21

22 ¶ His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. ^22

23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. ^23
