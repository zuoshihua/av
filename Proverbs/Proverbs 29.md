### Proverbs 29

1 HE, that being often reproved hardeneth _his_ neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. ^1

2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. ^2

3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth _his_ substance. ^3

4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. ^4

5 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. ^5

6 In the transgression of an evil man _there_ _is_ a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. ^6

7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: _but_ the wicked regardeth not to know _it_. ^7

8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise _men_ turn away wrath. ^8

9 _If_ a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, _there_ _is_ no rest. ^9

10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. ^10

11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise _man_ keepeth it in till afterwards. ^11

12 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants _are_ wicked. ^12

13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the $L{\small ORD}$ lighteneth both their eyes. ^13

14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. ^14

15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left _to_ _himself_ bringeth his mother to shame. ^15

16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. ^16

17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. ^17

18 Where _there_ _is_ no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy _is_ he. ^18

19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. ^19

20 Seest thou a man _that_ _is_ hasty in his words? _there_ _is_ more hope of a fool than of him. ^20

21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become _his_ son at the length. ^21

22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. ^22

23 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. ^23

24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth _it_ not. ^24

25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be safe. ^25

26 Many seek the ruler's favour; but _every_ man's judgment _cometh_ from the $L{\small ORD}$. ^26

27 An unjust man _is_ an abomination to the just: and _he_ _that_ _is_ upright in the way _is_ abomination to the wicked. ^27
