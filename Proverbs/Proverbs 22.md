### Proverbs 22

1 A _GOOD_ name _is_ rather to be chosen than great riches, _and_ loving favour rather than silver and gold. ^1

2 The rich and poor meet together: the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ the maker of them all. ^2

3 A prudent _man_ foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished. ^3

4 By humility _and_ the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ riches, and honour, and life. ^4

5 Thorns _and_ snares _are_ in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. ^5

6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. ^6

7 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower _is_ servant to the lender. ^7

8 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail. ^8

9 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor. ^9

10 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease. ^10

11 He that loveth pureness of heart, _for_ the grace of his lips the king _shall_ _be_ his friend. ^11

12 The eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$ preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. ^12

13 The slothful _man_ saith, _There_ _is_ a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets. ^13

14 The mouth of strange women _is_ a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall fall therein. ^14

15 Foolishness _is_ bound in the heart of a child; _but_ the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. ^15

16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his _riches_, _and_ he that giveth to the rich, _shall_ surely _come_ to want. ^16

17 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. ^17

18 For _it_ _is_ a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. ^18

19 That thy trust may be in the $L{\small ORD}$, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. ^19

20 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, ^20

21 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee? ^21

22 Rob not the poor, because he _is_ poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: ^22

23 For the $L{\small ORD}$ will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. ^23

24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: ^24

25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. ^25

26 Be not thou _one_ of them that strike hands, _or_ of them that are sureties for debts. ^26

27 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? ^27

28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. ^28

29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean _men_. ^29
