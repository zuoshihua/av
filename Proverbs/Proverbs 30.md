### Proverbs 30

1 THE words of Agur the son of Jakeh, _even_ the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, ^1

2 Surely I _am_ more brutish than _any_ man, and have not the understanding of a man. ^2

3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. ^3

4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what _is_ his name, and what _is_ his son's name, if thou canst tell? ^4

5 Every word of God _is_ pure: he _is_ a shield unto them that put their trust in him. ^5

6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. ^6

7 Two _things_ have I required of thee; deny me _them_ not before I die: ^7

8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: ^8

9 Lest I be full, and deny _thee_, and say, Who _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God _in_ _vain_. ^9

10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. ^10

11 _There_ _is_ a generation _that_ curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. ^11

12 _There_ _is_ a generation _that_ _are_ pure in their own eyes, and _yet_ is not washed from their filthiness. ^12

13 _There_ _is_ a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. ^13

14 _There_ _is_ a generation, whose teeth _are_ _as_ swords, and their jaw teeth _as_ knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from _among_ men. ^14

15 The horseleach hath two daughters, _crying_, Give, give. There are three _things_ _that_ are never satisfied, _yea_, four _things_ say not, _It_ _is_ enough: ^15

16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth _that_ is not filled with water; and the fire _that_ saith not, _It_ _is_ enough. ^16

17 The eye _that_ mocketh at _his_ father, and despiseth to obey _his_ mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. ^17

18 There be three _things_ _which_ are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: ^18

19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. ^19

20 Such _is_ the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. ^20

21 For three _things_ the earth is disquieted, and for four _which_ it cannot bear: ^21

22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; ^22

23 For an odious _woman_ when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. ^23

24 There be four _things_ _which_ _are_ little upon the earth, but they _are_ exceeding wise: ^24

25 The ants _are_ a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; ^25

26 The conies _are_ _but_ a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; ^26

27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; ^27

28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces. ^28

29 There be three _things_ which go well, yea, four are comely in going: ^29

30 A lion _which_ _is_ strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; ^30

31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom _there_ _is_ no rising up. ^31

32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, _lay_ thine hand upon thy mouth. ^32

33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. ^33
