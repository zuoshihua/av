### Proverbs 21

1 THE king's heart _is_ in the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$, _as_ the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. ^1

2 Every way of a man _is_ right in his own eyes: but the $L{\small ORD}$ pondereth the hearts. ^2

3 To do justice and judgment _is_ more acceptable to the $L{\small ORD}$ than sacrifice. ^3

4 An high look, and a proud heart, _and_ the plowing of the wicked, _is_ sin. ^4

5 The thoughts of the diligent _tend_ only to plenteousness; but of every one _that_ _is_ hasty only to want. ^5

6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue _is_ a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. ^6

7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. ^7

8 The way of man _is_ froward and strange: but _as_ _for_ the pure, his work _is_ right. ^8

9 _It_ _is_ better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. ^9

10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. ^10

11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. ^11

12 The righteous _man_ wisely considereth the house of the wicked: _but_ _God_ overthroweth the wicked for _their_ wickedness. ^12

13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. ^13

14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. ^14

15 _It_ _is_ joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction _shall_ _be_ to the workers of iniquity. ^15

16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. ^16

17 He that loveth pleasure _shall_ _be_ a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. ^17

18 The wicked _shall_ _be_ a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. ^18

19 _It_ _is_ better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. ^19

20 _There_ _is_ treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. ^20

21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. ^21

22 A wise _man_ scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. ^22

23 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. ^23

24 Proud _and_ haughty scorner _is_ his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. ^24

25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. ^25

26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. ^26

27 The sacrifice of the wicked _is_ abomination: how much more, _when_ he bringeth it with a wicked mind? ^27

28 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. ^28

29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but _as_ _for_ the upright, he directeth his way. ^29

30 _There_ _is_ no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^30

31 The horse _is_ prepared against the day of battle: but safety _is_ of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^31
