### Proverbs 27

1 BOAST not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. ^1

2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. ^2

3 A stone _is_ heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath _is_ heavier than them both. ^3

4 Wrath _is_ cruel, and anger _is_ outrageous; but who _is_ able to stand before envy? ^4

5 Open rebuke _is_ better than secret love. ^5

6 Faithful _are_ the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy _are_ deceitful. ^6

7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. ^7

8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so _is_ a man that wandereth from his place. ^8

9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so _doth_ the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. ^9

10 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: _for_ better _is_ a neighbour _that_ _is_ near than a brother far off. ^10

11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. ^11

12 A prudent _man_ foreseeth the evil, _and_ hideth himself; _but_ the simple pass on, _and_ are punished. ^12

13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. ^13

14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. ^14

15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. ^15

16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, _which_ bewrayeth _itself_. ^16

17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. ^17

18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. ^18

19 As in water face _answereth_ to face, so the heart of man to man. ^19

20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. ^20

21 _As_ the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so _is_ a man to his praise. ^21

22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, _yet_ will not his foolishness depart from him. ^22

23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, _and_ look well to thy herds. ^23

24 For riches _are_ not for ever: and doth the crown _endure_ to every generation? ^24

25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. ^25

26 The lambs _are_ for thy clothing, and the goats _are_ the price of the field. ^26

27 And _thou_ _shalt_ _have_ goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and _for_ the maintenance for thy maidens. ^27
