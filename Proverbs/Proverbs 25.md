### Proverbs 25

1 THESE _are_ also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. ^1

2 _It_ _is_ the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings _is_ to search out a matter. ^2

3 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings _is_ unsearchable. ^3

4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. ^4

5 Take away the wicked _from_ before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. ^5

6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great _men:_ ^6

7 For better _it_ _is_ that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. ^7

8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest _thou_ _know_ _not_ what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. ^8

9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour _himself;_ and discover not a secret to another: ^9

10 Lest he that heareth _it_ put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. ^10

11 A word fitly spoken _is_ _like_ apples of gold in pictures of silver. ^11

12 _As_ an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, _so_ _is_ a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. ^12

13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, _so_ _is_ a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. ^13

14 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift _is_ _like_ clouds and wind without rain. ^14

15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. ^15

16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. ^16

17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and _so_ hate thee. ^17

18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour _is_ a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. ^18

19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble _is_ _like_ a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. ^19

20 _As_ he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, _and_ _as_ vinegar upon nitre, so _is_ he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. ^20

21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: ^21

22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the $L{\small ORD}$ shall reward thee. ^22

23 The north wind driveth away rain: so _doth_ an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. ^23

24 _It_ _is_ better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. ^24

25 _As_ cold waters to a thirsty soul, so _is_ good news from a far country. ^25

26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked _is_ _as_ a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. ^26

27 _It_ _is_ not good to eat much honey: so _for_ _men_ to search their own glory _is_ _not_ glory. ^27

28 He that _hath_ no rule over his own spirit _is_ _like_ a city _that_ _is_ broken down, _and_ without walls. ^28
