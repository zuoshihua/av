### Proverbs 3

1 MY son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: ^1

2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. ^2

3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: ^3

4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. ^4

5 ¶ Trust in the $L{\small ORD}$ with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. ^5

6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. ^6

7 ¶ Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the $L{\small ORD}$, and depart from evil. ^7

8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. ^8

9 Honour the $L{\small ORD}$ with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: ^9

10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. ^10

11 ¶ My son, despise not the chastening of the $L{\small ORD}$; neither be weary of his correction: ^11

12 For whom the $L{\small ORD}$ loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son _in_ _whom_ he delighteth. ^12

13 ¶ Happy _is_ the man _that_ findeth wisdom, and the man _that_ getteth understanding. ^13

14 For the merchandise of it _is_ better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. ^14

15 She _is_ more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. ^15

16 Length of days _is_ in her right hand; _and_ in her left hand riches and honour. ^16

17 Her ways _are_ ways of pleasantness, and all her paths _are_ peace. ^17

18 She _is_ a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy _is_ _every_ _one_ that retaineth her. ^18

19 The $L{\small ORD}$ by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. ^19

20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. ^20

21 ¶ My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: ^21

22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. ^22

23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. ^23

24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. ^24

25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. ^25

26 For the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. ^26

27 ¶ Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do _it_. ^27

28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. ^28

29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. ^29

30 ¶ Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. ^30

31 ¶ Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. ^31

32 For the froward _is_ abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$: but his secret _is_ with the righteous. ^32

33 ¶ The curse of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. ^33

34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. ^34

35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. ^35
