### Proverbs 8

1 DOTH not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? ^1

2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. ^2

3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. ^3

4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice _is_ to the sons of man. ^4

5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. ^5

6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips _shall_ _be_ right things. ^6

7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness _is_ an abomination to my lips. ^7

8 All the words of my mouth _are_ in righteousness; _there_ _is_ nothing froward or perverse in them. ^8

9 They _are_ all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. ^9

10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. ^10

11 For wisdom _is_ better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. ^11

12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. ^12

13 The fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. ^13

14 Counsel _is_ mine, and sound wisdom: I _am_ understanding; I have strength. ^14

15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. ^15

16 By me princes rule, and nobles, _even_ all the judges of the earth. ^16

17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. ^17

18 Riches and honour _are_ with me; _yea_, durable riches and righteousness. ^18

19 My fruit _is_ better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. ^19

20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: ^20

21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. ^21

22 The $L{\small ORD}$ possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. ^22

23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. ^23

24 When _there_ _were_ no depths, I was brought forth; when _there_ _were_ no fountains abounding with water. ^24

25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: ^25

26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. ^26

27 When he prepared the heavens, I _was_ there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: ^27

28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: ^28

29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: ^29

30 Then I was by him, _as_ one brought up _with_ _him:_ and I was daily _his_ delight, rejoicing always before him; ^30

31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights _were_ with the sons of men. ^31

32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed _are_ _they_ _that_ keep my ways. ^32

33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. ^33

34 Blessed _is_ the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. ^34

35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^35

36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death. ^36
