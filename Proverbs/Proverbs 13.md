### Proverbs 13

1 A WISE son _heareth_ his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. ^1

2 A man shall eat good by the fruit of _his_ mouth: but the soul of the transgressors _shall_ _eat_ violence. ^2

3 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: _but_ he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. ^3

4 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and _hath_ nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. ^4

5 A righteous _man_ hateth lying: but a wicked _man_ is loathsome, and cometh to shame. ^5

6 Righteousness keepeth _him_ _that_ _is_ upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. ^6

7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet _hath_ nothing: _there_ _is_ that maketh himself poor, yet _hath_ great riches. ^7

8 The ransom of a man's life _are_ his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke. ^8

9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. ^9

10 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised _is_ wisdom. ^10

11 Wealth _gotten_ by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase. ^11

12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but _when_ the desire cometh, _it_ _is_ a tree of life. ^12

13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. ^13

14 The law of the wise _is_ a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. ^14

15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors _is_ hard. ^15

16 Every prudent _man_ dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open _his_ folly. ^16

17 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador _is_ health. ^17

18 Poverty and shame _shall_ _be_ _to_ him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. ^18

19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but _it_ _is_ abomination to fools to depart from evil. ^19

20 He that walketh with wise _men_ shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. ^20

21 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed. ^21

22 A good _man_ leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner _is_ laid up for the just. ^22

23 Much food _is_ _in_ the tillage of the poor: but there is _that_ _is_ destroyed for want of judgment. ^23

24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. ^24

25 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want. ^25
