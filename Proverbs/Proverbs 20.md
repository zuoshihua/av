### Proverbs 20

1 WINE _is_ a mocker, strong drink _is_ raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. ^1

2 The fear of a king _is_ as the roaring of a lion: _whoso_ provoketh him to anger sinneth _against_ his own soul. ^2

3 _It_ _is_ an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling. ^3

4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; _therefore_ shall he beg in harvest, and _have_ nothing. ^4

5 Counsel in the heart of man _is_ _like_ deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. ^5

6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? ^6

7 The just _man_ walketh in his integrity: his children _are_ blessed after him. ^7

8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. ^8

9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? ^9

10 Divers weights, _and_ divers measures, both of them _are_ alike abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work _be_ pure, and whether _it_ _be_ right. ^11

12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the $L{\small ORD}$ hath made even both of them. ^12

13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, _and_ thou shalt be satisfied with bread. ^13

14 _It_ _is_ naught, _it_ _is_ naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. ^14

15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge _are_ a precious jewel. ^15

16 Take his garment that is surety _for_ a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. ^16

17 Bread of deceit _is_ sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. ^17

18 _Every_ purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. ^18

19 He that goeth about _as_ a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. ^19

20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. ^20

21 An inheritance _may_ _be_ gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. ^21

22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; _but_ wait on the $L{\small ORD}$, and he shall save thee. ^22

23 Divers weights _are_ an abomination unto the $L{\small ORD}$; and a false balance _is_ not good. ^23

24 Man's goings _are_ of the $L{\small ORD}$; how can a man then understand his own way? ^24

25 _It_ _is_ a snare to the man _who_ devoureth _that_ _which_ _is_ holy, and after vows to make inquiry. ^25

26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. ^26

27 The spirit of man _is_ the candle of the $L{\small ORD}$, searching all the inward parts of the belly. ^27

28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. ^28

29 The glory of young men _is_ their strength: and the beauty of old men _is_ the gray head. ^29

30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so _do_ stripes the inward parts of the belly. ^30
