### Proverbs 11

1 A FALSE balance _is_ abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$: but a just weight _is_ his delight. ^1

2 _When_ pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly _is_ wisdom. ^2

3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them. ^3

4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death. ^4

5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. ^5

6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in _their_ _own_ naughtiness. ^6

7 When a wicked man dieth, _his_ expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust _men_ perisheth. ^7

8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. ^8

9 An hypocrite with _his_ mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered. ^9

10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, _there_ _is_ shouting. ^10

11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. ^11

12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. ^12

13 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter. ^13

14 Where no counsel _is_, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellers _there_ _is_ safety. ^14

15 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart _for_ _it:_ and he that hateth suretiship is sure. ^15

16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong _men_ retain riches. ^16

17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but _he_ _that_ _is_ cruel troubleth his own flesh. ^17

18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness _shall_ _be_ a sure reward. ^18

19 As righteousness _tendeth_ to life: so he that pursueth evil _pursueth_ _it_ to his own death. ^19

20 They that are of a froward heart _are_ abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$: but _such_ _as_ _are_ upright in _their_ way _are_ his delight. ^20

21 _Though_ hand _join_ in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. ^21

22 _As_ a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, _so_ _is_ a fair woman which is without discretion. ^22

23 The desire of the righteous _is_ only good: _but_ the expectation of the wicked _is_ wrath. ^23

24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and _there_ _is_ that withholdeth more than is meet, but _it_ _tendeth_ to poverty. ^24

25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. ^25

26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing _shall_ _be_ upon the head of him that selleth _it_. ^26

27 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him. ^27

28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch. ^28

29 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool _shall_ _be_ servant to the wise of heart. ^29

30 The fruit of the righteous _is_ a tree of life; and he that winneth souls _is_ wise. ^30

31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner. ^31
