### Proverbs 17

1 BETTER _is_ a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices _with_ strife. ^1

2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. ^2

3 The fining pot _is_ for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the $L{\small ORD}$ trieth the hearts. ^3

4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; _and_ a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. ^4

5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: _and_ he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. ^5

6 Children's children _are_ the crown of old men; and the glory of children _are_ their fathers. ^6

7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. ^7

8 A gift _is_ _as_ a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. ^8

9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth _very_ friends. ^9

10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. ^10

11 An evil _man_ seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. ^11

12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. ^12

13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. ^13

14 The beginning of strife _is_ _as_ when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. ^14

15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both _are_ abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$. ^15

16 Wherefore _is_ _there_ a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing _he_ _hath_ no heart _to_ _it?_ ^16

17 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. ^17

18 A man void of understanding striketh hands, _and_ becometh surety in the presence of his friend. ^18

19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: _and_ he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. ^19

20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. ^20

21 He that begetteth a fool _doeth_ _it_ to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. ^21

22 A merry heart doeth good _like_ a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. ^22

23 A wicked _man_ taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. ^23

24 Wisdom _is_ before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool _are_ in the ends of the earth. ^24

25 A foolish son _is_ a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. ^25

26 Also to punish the just _is_ not good, _nor_ to strike princes for equity. ^26

27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: _and_ a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. ^27

28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: _and_ he that shutteth his lips _is_ _esteemed_ a man of understanding. ^28
