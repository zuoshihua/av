### Proverbs 24

1 BE not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. ^1

2 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. ^2

3 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: ^3

4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. ^4

5 A wise man _is_ strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. ^5

6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellers _there_ _is_ safety. ^6

7 Wisdom _is_ too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. ^7

8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. ^8

9 The thought of foolishness _is_ sin: and the scorner _is_ an abomination to men. ^9

10 _If_ thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength _is_ small. ^10

11 If thou forbear to deliver _them_ _that_ _are_ drawn unto death, and _those_ _that_ _are_ ready to be slain; ^11

12 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider _it?_ and he that keepeth thy soul, doth _not_ he know _it?_ and shall _not_ he render to _every_ man according to his works? ^12

13 My son, eat thou honey, because _it_ _is_ good; and the honeycomb, _which_ _is_ sweet to thy taste: ^13

14 So _shall_ the knowledge of wisdom _be_ unto thy soul: when thou hast found _it_, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off. ^14

15 Lay not wait, O wicked _man_, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: ^15

16 For a just _man_ falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. ^16

17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: ^17

18 Lest the $L{\small ORD}$ see _it_, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. ^18

19 Fret not thyself because of evil _men_, neither be thou envious at the wicked; ^19

20 For there shall be no reward to the evil _man;_ the candle of the wicked shall be put out. ^20

21 My son, fear thou the $L{\small ORD}$ and the king: _and_ meddle not with them that are given to change: ^21

22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? ^22

23 These _things_ also _belong_ to the wise. _It_ _is_ not good to have respect of persons in judgment. ^23

24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou _art_ righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: ^24

25 But to them that rebuke _him_ shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. ^25

26 _Every_ _man_ shall kiss _his_ lips that giveth a right answer. ^26

27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. ^27

28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive _not_ with thy lips. ^28

29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. ^29

30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; ^30

31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, _and_ nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. ^31

32 Then I saw, _and_ considered _it_ well: I looked upon _it_, _and_ received instruction. ^32

33 _Yet_ a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: ^33

34 So shall thy poverty come _as_ one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. ^34
