### Proverbs 7

1 MY son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. ^1

2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. ^2

3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. ^3

4 Say unto wisdom, Thou _art_ my sister; and call understanding _thy_ kinswoman: ^4

5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger _which_ flattereth with her words. ^5

6 ¶ For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, ^6

7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, ^7

8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, ^8

9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: ^9

10 And, behold, there met him a woman _with_ the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. ^10

11 (She _is_ loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: ^11

12 Now _is_ _she_ without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) ^12

13 So she caught him, and kissed him, _and_ with an impudent face said unto him, ^13

14 _I_ _have_ peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. ^14

15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. ^15

16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved _works_, with fine linen of Egypt. ^16

17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. ^17

18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. ^18

19 For the goodman _is_ not at home, he is gone a long journey: ^19

20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, _and_ will come home at the day appointed. ^20

21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. ^21

22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; ^22

23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it _is_ for his life. ^23

24 ¶ Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. ^24

25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. ^25

26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong _men_ have been slain by her. ^26

27 Her house _is_ the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. ^27
