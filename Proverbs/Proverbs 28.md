### Proverbs 28

1 THE wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. ^1

2 For the transgression of a land many _are_ the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding _and_ knowledge the state _thereof_ shall be prolonged. ^2

3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor _is_ _like_ a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. ^3

4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. ^4

5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the $L{\small ORD}$ understand all _things_. ^5

6 Better _is_ the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than _he_ _that_ _is_ perverse _in_ _his_ ways, though he _be_ rich. ^6

7 Whoso keepeth the law _is_ a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous _men_ shameth his father. ^7

8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. ^8

9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer _shall_ _be_ abomination. ^9

10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good _things_ in possession. ^10

11 The rich man _is_ wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. ^11

12 When righteous _men_ do rejoice, _there_ _is_ great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. ^12

13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh _them_ shall have mercy. ^13

14 Happy _is_ the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. ^14

15 _As_ a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; _so_ _is_ a wicked ruler over the poor people. ^15

16 The prince that wanteth understanding _is_ also a great oppressor: _but_ he that hateth covetousness shall prolong _his_ days. ^16

17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of _any_ person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. ^17

18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but _he_ _that_ _is_ perverse _in_ _his_ ways shall fall at once. ^18

19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain _persons_ shall have poverty enough. ^19

20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. ^20

21 To have respect of persons _is_ not good: for for a piece of bread _that_ man will transgress. ^21

22 He that hasteth to be rich _hath_ an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. ^22

23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. ^23

24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, _It_ _is_ no transgression; the same _is_ the companion of a destroyer. ^24

25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be made fat. ^25

26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. ^26

27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. ^27

28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. ^28
