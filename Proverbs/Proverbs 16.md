### Proverbs 16

1 THE preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, _is_ from the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 All the ways of a man _are_ clean in his own eyes; but the $L{\small ORD}$ weigheth the spirits. ^2

3 Commit thy works unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and thy thoughts shall be established. ^3

4 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath made all _things_ for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. ^4

5 Every one _that_ _is_ proud in heart _is_ an abomination to the $L{\small ORD}$: _though_ hand _join_ in hand, he shall not be unpunished. ^5

6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _men_ depart from evil. ^6

7 When a man's ways please the $L{\small ORD}$, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. ^7

8 Better _is_ a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. ^8

9 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the $L{\small ORD}$ directeth his steps. ^9

10 A divine sentence _is_ in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. ^10

11 A just weight and balance _are_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s: all the weights of the bag _are_ his work. ^11

12 _It_ _is_ an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness. ^12

13 Righteous lips _are_ the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. ^13

14 The wrath of a king _is_ _as_ messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. ^14

15 In the light of the king's countenance _is_ life; and his favour _is_ as a cloud of the latter rain. ^15

16 How much better _is_ _it_ to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! ^16

17 The highway of the upright _is_ to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. ^17

18 Pride _goeth_ before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. ^18

19 Better _it_ _is_ _to_ _be_ of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. ^19

20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the $L{\small ORD}$, happy _is_ he. ^20

21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. ^21

22 Understanding _is_ a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools _is_ folly. ^22

23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. ^23

24 Pleasant words _are_ _as_ an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. ^24

25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof _are_ the ways of death. ^25

26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him. ^26

27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips _there_ _is_ as a burning fire. ^27

28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. ^28

29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way _that_ _is_ not good. ^29

30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. ^30

31 The hoary head _is_ a crown of glory, _if_ it be found in the way of righteousness. ^31

32 _He_ _that_ _is_ slow to anger _is_ better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. ^32

33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof _is_ of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^33
