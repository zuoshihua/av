### 1 Samuel 12

1 AND Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. ^1

2 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons _are_ with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day. ^2

3 Behold, here I _am:_ witness against me before the $L{\small ORD}$, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received _any_ bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you. ^3

4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand. ^4

5 And he said unto them, The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ witness against you, and his anointed _is_ witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, _He_ _is_ witness. ^5

6 ¶ And Samuel said unto the people, _It_ _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$ that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. ^6

7 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the $L{\small ORD}$ of all the righteous acts of the $L{\small ORD}$, which he did to you and to your fathers. ^7

8 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$, then the $L{\small ORD}$ sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. ^8

9 And when they forgat the $L{\small ORD}$ their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. ^9

10 And they cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the $L{\small ORD}$, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. ^10

11 And the $L{\small ORD}$ sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. ^11

12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the $L{\small ORD}$ your God _was_ your king. ^12

13 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, _and_ whom ye have desired! and, behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ hath set a king over you. ^13

14 If ye will fear the $L{\small ORD}$, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the $L{\small ORD}$ your God: ^14

15 But if ye will not obey the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$, but rebel against the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$, then shall the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ be against you, as _it_ _was_ against your fathers. ^15

16 ¶ Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the $L{\small ORD}$ will do before your eyes. ^16

17 _Is_ _it_ not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness _is_ great, which ye have done in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, in asking you a king. ^17

18 So Samuel called unto the $L{\small ORD}$; and the $L{\small ORD}$ sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the $L{\small ORD}$ and Samuel. ^18

19 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins _this_ evil, to ask us a king. ^19

20 ¶ And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the $L{\small ORD}$, but serve the $L{\small ORD}$ with all your heart; ^20

21 And turn ye not aside: for _then_ _should_ _ye_ _go_ after vain _things_, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they _are_ vain. ^21

22 For the $L{\small ORD}$ will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the $L{\small ORD}$ to make you his people. ^22

23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the $L{\small ORD}$ in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way: ^23

24 Only fear the $L{\small ORD}$, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great _things_ he hath done for you. ^24

25 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king. ^25
