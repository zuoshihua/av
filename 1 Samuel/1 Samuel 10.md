### 1 Samuel 10

1 THEN Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured _it_ upon his head, and kissed him, and said, _Is_ _it_ not because the $L{\small ORD}$ hath anointed thee _to_ _be_ captain over his inheritance? ^1

2 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? ^2

3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: ^3

4 And they will salute thee, and give thee two _loaves_ of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands. ^4

5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where _is_ the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: ^5

6 And the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. ^6

7 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, _that_ thou do as occasion serve thee; for God _is_ with thee. ^7

8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, _and_ to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. ^8

9 ¶ And it was _so_, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. ^9

10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. ^10

11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What _is_ this _that_ is come unto the son of Kish? _Is_ Saul also among the prophets? ^11

12 And one of the same place answered and said, But who _is_ their father? Therefore it became a proverb, _Is_ Saul also among the prophets? ^12

13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. ^13

14 ¶ And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that _they_ _were_ no where, we came to Samuel. ^14

15 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you. ^15

16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not. ^16

17 ¶ And Samuel called the people together unto the $L{\small ORD}$ to Mizpeh; ^17

18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, _and_ of them that oppressed you: ^18

19 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, _Nay_, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the $L{\small ORD}$ by your tribes, and by your thousands. ^19

20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken. ^20

21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found. ^21

22 Therefore they inquired of the $L{\small ORD}$ further, if the man should yet come thither. And the $L{\small ORD}$ answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff. ^22

23 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. ^23

24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the $L{\small ORD}$ hath chosen, that _there_ _is_ none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king. ^24

25 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote _it_ in a book, and laid _it_ up before the $L{\small ORD}$. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. ^25

26 ¶ And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched. ^26

27 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace. ^27
