### 1 Samuel 30

1 AND it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; ^1

2 And had taken the women captives, that _were_ therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried _them_ away, and went on their way. ^2

3 ¶ So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, _it_ _was_ burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. ^3

4 Then David and the people that _were_ with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. ^4

5 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. ^5

6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the $L{\small ORD}$ his God. ^6

7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. ^7

8 And David inquired at the $L{\small ORD}$, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake _them_, and without fail recover _all_. ^8

9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that _were_ with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed. ^9

10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor. ^10

11 ¶ And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water; ^11

12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk _any_ water, three days and three nights. ^12

13 And David said unto him, To whom _belongest_ thou? and whence _art_ thou? And he said, I _am_ a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick. ^13

14 We made an invasion _upon_ the south of the Cherethites, and upon _the_ _coast_ which _belongeth_ to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. ^14

15 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company. ^15

16 ¶ And when he had brought him down, behold, _they_ _were_ spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. ^16

17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled. ^17

18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives. ^18

19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any _thing_ that they had taken to them: David recovered all. ^19

20 And David took all the flocks and the herds, _which_ they drave before those _other_ cattle, and said, This _is_ David's spoil. ^20

21 ¶ And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that _were_ with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them. ^21

22 Then answered all the wicked men and _men_ of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them _ought_ of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead _them_ away, and depart. ^22

23 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand. ^23

24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part _is_ that goeth down to the battle, so _shall_ his part _be_ that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike. ^24

25 And it was _so_ from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. ^25

26 ¶ And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, _even_ to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the $L{\small ORD}$; ^26

27 To _them_ which _were_ in Beth-el, and to _them_ which _were_ in south Ramoth, and to _them_ which _were_ in Jattir, ^27

28 And to _them_ which _were_ in Aroer, and to _them_ which _were_ in Siphmoth, and to _them_ which _were_ in Eshtemoa, ^28

29 And to _them_ which _were_ in Rachal, and to _them_ which _were_ in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to _them_ which _were_ in the cities of the Kenites, ^29

30 And to _them_ which _were_ in Hormah, and to _them_ which _were_ in Chor-ashan, and to _them_ which _were_ in Athach, ^30

31 And to _them_ which _were_ in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt. ^31
