### 1 Samuel 9

1 NOW there was a man of Benjamin, whose name _was_ Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. ^1

2 And he had a son, whose name _was_ Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and _there_ _was_ not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward _he_ _was_ higher than any of the people. ^2

3 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. ^3

4 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found _them_ not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and _there_ _they_ _were_ not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found _them_ not. ^4

5 _And_ when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that _was_ with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave _caring_ for the asses, and take thought for us. ^5

6 And he said unto him, Behold now, _there_ _is_ in this city a man of God, and _he_ _is_ an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. ^6

7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, _if_ we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and _there_ _is_ not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? ^7

8 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: _that_ will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. ^8

9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for _he_ _that_ _is_ now _called_ a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) ^9

10 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God _was_. ^10

11 ¶ _And_ as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? ^11

12 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, _he_ _is_ before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for _there_ _is_ a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: ^12

13 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; _and_ afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. ^13

14 And they went up into the city: _and_ when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. ^14

15 ¶ Now the $L{\small ORD}$ had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, ^15

16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him _to_ _be_ captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. ^16

17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. ^17

18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house _is_. ^18

19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I _am_ the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that _is_ in thine heart. ^19

20 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom _is_ all the desire of Israel? _Is_ _it_ not on thee, and on all thy father's house? ^20

21 And Saul answered and said, _Am_ not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me? ^21

22 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which _were_ about thirty persons. ^22

23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. ^23

24 And the cook took up the shoulder, and _that_ which _was_ upon it, and set _it_ before Saul. And _Samuel_ said, Behold that which is left! set _it_ before thee, _and_ eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. ^24

25 ¶ And when they were come down from the high place into the city, _Samuel_ communed with Saul upon the top of the house. ^25

26 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. ^26

27 _And_ as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God. ^27
