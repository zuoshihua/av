### 1 Samuel 3

1 AND the child Samuel ministered unto the $L{\small ORD}$ before Eli. And the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ was precious in those days; _there_ _was_ no open vision. ^1

2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli _was_ laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, _that_ he could not see; ^2

3 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$, where the ark of God _was_, and Samuel was laid down _to_ _sleep;_ ^3

4 That the $L{\small ORD}$ called Samuel: and he answered, Here _am_ I. ^4

5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here _am_ I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. ^5

6 And the $L{\small ORD}$ called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here _am_ I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. ^6

7 Now Samuel did not yet know the $L{\small ORD}$, neither was the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ yet revealed unto him. ^7

8 And the $L{\small ORD}$ called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here _am_ I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the $L{\small ORD}$ had called the child. ^8

9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, $L{\small ORD}$; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. ^9

10 And the $L{\small ORD}$ came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. ^10

11 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. ^11

12 In that day I will perform against Eli all _things_ which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. ^12

13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. ^13

14 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. ^14

15 ¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. ^15

16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here _am_ I. ^16

17 And he said, What _is_ the thing that _the_ _$L{\small ORD}$_ hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide _it_ not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide _any_ thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. ^17

18 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$: let him do what seemeth him good. ^18

19 ¶ And Samuel grew, and the $L{\small ORD}$ was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. ^19

20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel _was_ established _to_ _be_ a prophet of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20

21 And the $L{\small ORD}$ appeared again in Shiloh: for the $L{\small ORD}$ revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21
