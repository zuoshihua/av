### 1 Samuel 15

1 SAMUEL also said unto Saul, The $L{\small ORD}$ sent me to anoint thee _to_ _be_ king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, I remember _that_ which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid _wait_ for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. ^2

3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. ^3

4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. ^4

5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. ^5

6 ¶ And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. ^6

7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah _until_ thou comest to Shur, that _is_ over against Egypt. ^7

8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. ^8

9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all _that_ _was_ good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing _that_ _was_ vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. ^9

10 ¶ Then came the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ unto Samuel, saying, ^10

11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul _to_ _be_ king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$ all night. ^11

12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. ^12

13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed _be_ thou of the $L{\small ORD}$: I have performed the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 And Samuel said, What _meaneth_ then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? ^14

15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. ^15

16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the $L{\small ORD}$ hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. ^16

17 And Samuel said, When thou _wast_ little in thine own sight, _wast_ thou not _made_ the head of the tribes of Israel, and the $L{\small ORD}$ anointed thee king over Israel? ^17

18 And the $L{\small ORD}$ sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. ^18

19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$? ^19

20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$, and have gone the way which the $L{\small ORD}$ sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. ^20

21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God in Gilgal. ^21

22 And Samuel said, Hath the $L{\small ORD}$ _as_ _great_ delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$? Behold, to obey _is_ better than sacrifice, _and_ to hearken than the fat of rams. ^22

23 For rebellion _is_ _as_ the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness _is_ _as_ iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, he hath also rejected thee from _being_ king. ^23

24 ¶ And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. ^24

25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the $L{\small ORD}$. ^25

26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, and the $L{\small ORD}$ hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. ^26

27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. ^27

28 And Samuel said unto him, The $L{\small ORD}$ hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, _that_ _is_ better than thou. ^28

29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he _is_ not a man, that he should repent. ^29

30 Then he said, I have sinned: _yet_ honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God. ^30

31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the $L{\small ORD}$. ^31

32 ¶ Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. ^32

33 And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the $L{\small ORD}$ in Gilgal. ^33

34 ¶ Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. ^34

35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the $L{\small ORD}$ repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. ^35
