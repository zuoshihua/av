### 1 Samuel 16

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. ^1

2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear _it_, he will kill me. And the $L{\small ORD}$ said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the $L{\small ORD}$. ^2

3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me _him_ whom I name unto thee. ^3

4 And Samuel did that which the $L{\small ORD}$ spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? ^4

5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the $L{\small ORD}$: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. ^5

6 ¶ And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the $L{\small ORD}$'s anointed _is_ before him. ^6

7 But the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for _the_ _$L{\small ORD}$_ _seeth_ not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the $L{\small ORD}$ looketh on the heart. ^7

8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the $L{\small ORD}$ chosen this. ^8

9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the $L{\small ORD}$ chosen this. ^9

10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The $L{\small ORD}$ hath not chosen these. ^10

11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all _thy_ children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. ^11

12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he _was_ ruddy, _and_ withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the $L{\small ORD}$ said, Arise, anoint him: for this _is_ he. ^12

13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. ^13

14 ¶ But the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the $L{\small ORD}$ troubled him. ^14

15 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. ^15

16 Let our lord now command thy servants, _which_ _are_ before thee, to seek out a man, _who_ _is_ a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. ^16

17 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring _him_ to me. ^17

18 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, _that_ _is_ cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ with him. ^18

19 ¶ Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which _is_ with the sheep. ^19

20 And Jesse took an ass _laden_ with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent _them_ by David his son unto Saul. ^20

21 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. ^21

22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. ^22

23 And it came to pass, when the _evil_ spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. ^23
