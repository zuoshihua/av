### 1 Samuel 1

1 NOW there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name _was_ Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: ^1

2 And he had two wives; the name of the one _was_ Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. ^2

3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the $L{\small ORD}$, _were_ there. ^3

4 ¶ And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: ^4

5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the $L{\small ORD}$ had shut up her womb. ^5

6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the $L{\small ORD}$ had shut up her womb. ^6

7 And _as_ he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. ^7

8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? _am_ not I better to thee than ten sons? ^8

9 ¶ So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 And she _was_ in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and wept sore. ^10

11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the $L{\small ORD}$ all the days of his life, and there shall no rasor come upon his head. ^11

12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the $L{\small ORD}$, that Eli marked her mouth. ^12

13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. ^13

14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. ^14

15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I _am_ a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^15

16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. ^16

17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant _thee_ thy petition that thou hast asked of him. ^17

18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more _sad_. ^18

19 ¶ And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the $L{\small ORD}$, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the $L{\small ORD}$ remembered her. ^19

20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, _saying_, Because I have asked him of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20

21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the $L{\small ORD}$ the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. ^21

22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, _I_ _will_ _not_ _go_ _up_ until the child be weaned, and _then_ I will bring him, that he may appear before the $L{\small ORD}$, and there abide for ever. ^22

23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the $L{\small ORD}$ establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. ^23

24 ¶ And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ in Shiloh: and the child _was_ young. ^24

25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. ^25

26 And she said, Oh my lord, _as_ thy soul liveth, my lord, I _am_ the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^26

27 For this child I prayed; and the $L{\small ORD}$ hath given me my petition which I asked of him: ^27

28 Therefore also I have lent him to the $L{\small ORD}$; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the $L{\small ORD}$. And he worshipped the $L{\small ORD}$ there. ^28
