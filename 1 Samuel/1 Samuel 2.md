### 1 Samuel 2

1 AND Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the $L{\small ORD}$, mine horn is exalted in the $L{\small ORD}$: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. ^1

2 _There_ _is_ none holy as the $L{\small ORD}$: for _there_ _is_ none beside thee: neither _is_ _there_ any rock like our God. ^2

3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let _not_ arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. ^3

4 The bows of the mighty men _are_ broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. ^4

5 _They_ _that_ _were_ full have hired out themselves for bread; and _they_ _that_ _were_ hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. ^5

6 The $L{\small ORD}$ killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. ^6

7 The $L{\small ORD}$ maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. ^7

8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, _and_ lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set _them_ among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth _are_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s, and he hath set the world upon them. ^8

9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. ^9

10 The adversaries of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the $L{\small ORD}$ shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. ^10

11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the $L{\small ORD}$ before Eli the priest. ^11

12 ¶ Now the sons of Eli _were_ sons of Belial; they knew not the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12

13 And the priests' custom with the people _was_, _that_, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; ^13

14 And he struck _it_ into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. ^14

15 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. ^15

16 And _if_ any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and _then_ take _as_ _much_ as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, _Nay;_ but thou shalt give _it_ _me_ now: and if not, I will take _it_ by force. ^16

17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the $L{\small ORD}$: for men abhorred the offering of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 ¶ But Samuel ministered before the $L{\small ORD}$, _being_ a child, girded with a linen ephod. ^18

19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought _it_ to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. ^19

20 ¶ And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The $L{\small ORD}$ give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the $L{\small ORD}$. And they went unto their own home. ^20

21 And the $L{\small ORD}$ visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21

22 ¶ Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled _at_ the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. ^22

23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. ^23

24 Nay, my sons; for _it_ _is_ no good report that I hear: ye make the $L{\small ORD}$'s people to transgress. ^24

25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the $L{\small ORD}$, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the $L{\small ORD}$ would slay them. ^25

26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the $L{\small ORD}$, and also with men. ^26

27 ¶ And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? ^27

28 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel _to_ _be_ my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? ^28

29 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded _in_ _my_ habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? ^29

30 Wherefore the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel saith, I said indeed _that_ thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the $L{\small ORD}$ saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. ^30

31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. ^31

32 And thou shalt see an enemy _in_ _my_ habitation, in all _the_ _wealth_ which _God_ shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. ^32

33 And the man of thine, _whom_ I shall not cut off from mine altar, _shall_ _be_ to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. ^33

34 And this _shall_ _be_ a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. ^34

35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, _that_ shall do according to _that_ which _is_ in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. ^35

36 And it shall come to pass, _that_ every one that is left in thine house shall come _and_ crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread. ^36
