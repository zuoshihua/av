### 1 Samuel 31

1 NOW the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. ^1

2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul's sons. ^2

3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. ^3

4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. ^4

5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. ^5

6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. ^6

7 ¶ And when the men of Israel that _were_ on the other side of the valley, and _they_ that _were_ on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. ^7

8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. ^8

9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish _it_ _in_ the house of their idols, and among the people. ^9

10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. ^10

11 ¶ And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul; ^11

12 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. ^12

13 And they took their bones, and buried _them_ under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. ^13
