### Acts 18

1 AFTER these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; ^1

2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. ^2

3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. ^3

4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. ^4

5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews _that_ Jesus _was_ Christ. ^5

6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook _his_ raiment, and said unto them, Your blood _be_ upon your own heads; I _am_ clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. ^6

7 ¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain _man_'_s_ house, named Justus, _one_ that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. ^7

8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. ^8

9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: ^9

10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. ^10

11 And he continued _there_ a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. ^11

12 ¶ And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, ^12

13 Saying, This _fellow_ persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. ^13

14 And when Paul was now about to open _his_ mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O _ye_ Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: ^14

15 But if it be a question of words and names, and _of_ your law, look ye _to_ _it;_ for I will be no judge of such _matters_. ^15

16 And he drave them from the judgment seat. ^16

17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat _him_ before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. ^17

18 ¶ And Paul _after_ _this_ tarried _there_ yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn _his_ head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. ^18

19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. ^19

20 When they desired _him_ to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; ^20

21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. ^21

22 And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. ^22

23 And after he had spent some time _there_, he departed, and went over _all_ the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. ^23

24 ¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, _and_ mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. ^24

25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. ^25

26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto _them_, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. ^26

27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: ^27

28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, _and_ _that_ publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. ^28
