### Acts 6

1 AND in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. ^1

2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples _unto_ _them_, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. ^2

3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. ^3

4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. ^4

5 ¶ And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: ^5

6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid _their_ hands on them. ^6

7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. ^7

8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. ^8

9 ¶ Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called _the_ _synagogue_ of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. ^9

10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. ^10

11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and _against_ God. ^11

12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon _him_, and caught him, and brought _him_ to the council, ^12

13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: ^13

14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. ^14

15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. ^15
