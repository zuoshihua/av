### 1 Corinthians 13

1 THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become _as_ sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. ^1

2 And though I have _the_ _gift_ _of_ prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. ^2

3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed _the_ _poor_, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. ^3

4 Charity suffereth long, _and_ is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, ^4

5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; ^5

6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; ^6

7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. ^7

8 Charity never faileth: but whether _there_ _be_ prophecies, they shall fail; whether _there_ _be_ tongues, they shall cease; whether _there_ _be_ knowledge, it shall vanish away. ^8

9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. ^9

10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. ^10

11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. ^11

12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. ^12

13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these _is_ charity. ^13
