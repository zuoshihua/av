### 1 Corinthians 11

1 BE ye followers of me, even as I also _am_ of Christ. ^1

2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered _them_ to you. ^2

3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman _is_ the man; and the head of Christ _is_ God. ^3

4 Every man praying or prophesying, having _his_ head covered, dishonoureth his head. ^4

5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with _her_ head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. ^5

6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. ^6

7 For a man indeed ought not to cover _his_ head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. ^7

8 For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. ^8

9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. ^9

10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on _her_ head because of the angels. ^10

11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. ^11

12 For as the woman _is_ of the man, even so _is_ the man also by the woman; but all things of God. ^12

13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? ^13

14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? ^14

15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for _her_ hair is given her for a covering. ^15

16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. ^16

17 Now in this that I declare _unto_ _you_ I praise _you_ not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. ^17

18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. ^18

19 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. ^19

20 When ye come together therefore into one place, _this_ is not to eat the Lord's supper. ^20

21 For in eating every one taketh before _other_ his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. ^21

22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise _you_ not. ^22

23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the _same_ night in which he was betrayed took bread: ^23

24 And when he had given thanks, he brake _it_, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. ^24

25 After the same manner also _he_ _took_ the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink _it_, in remembrance of me. ^25

26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. ^26

27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink _this_ cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. ^27

28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of _that_ bread, and drink of _that_ cup. ^28

29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. ^29

30 For this cause many _are_ weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. ^30

31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. ^31

32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. ^32

33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. ^33

34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. ^34
