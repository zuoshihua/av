### 1 Corinthians 4

1 LET a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. ^1

2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. ^2

3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. ^3

4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. ^4

5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. ^5

6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and _to_ Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think _of_ _men_ above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. ^6

7 For who maketh thee to differ _from_ _another?_ and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive _it_, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received _it?_ ^7

8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. ^8

9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. ^9

10 We _are_ fools for Christ's sake, but ye _are_ wise in Christ; we _are_ weak, but ye _are_ strong; ye _are_ honourable, but we _are_ despised. ^10

11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; ^11

12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: ^12

13 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, _and_ _are_ the offscouring of all things unto this day. ^13

14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn _you_. ^14

15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet _have_ _ye_ not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. ^15

16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. ^16

17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. ^17

18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. ^18

19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. ^19

20 For the kingdom of God _is_ not in word, but in power. ^20

21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and _in_ the spirit of meekness? ^21
