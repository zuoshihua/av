### Colossians 3

1 IF ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. ^1

2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. ^2

3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. ^3

4 When Christ, _who_ _is_ our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. ^4

5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: ^5

6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: ^6

7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. ^7

8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. ^8

9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; ^9

10 And have put on the new _man_, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: ^10

11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond _nor_ free: but Christ _is_ all, and in all. ^11

12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; ^12

13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also _do_ ye. ^13

14 And above all these things _put_ _on_ charity, which is the bond of perfectness. ^14

15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. ^15

16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. ^16

17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, _do_ all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. ^17

18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. ^18

19 Husbands, love _your_ wives, and be not bitter against them. ^19

20 Children, obey _your_ parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. ^20

21 Fathers, provoke not your children _to_ _anger_, lest they be discouraged. ^21

22 Servants, obey in all things _your_ masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: ^22

23 And whatsoever ye do, do _it_ heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; ^23

24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. ^24

25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons. ^25
