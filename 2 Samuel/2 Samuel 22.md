### 2 Samuel 22

1 AND David spake unto the $L{\small ORD}$ the words of this song in the day _that_ the $L{\small ORD}$ had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: ^1

2 And he said, The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; ^2

3 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: _he_ _is_ my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. ^3

4 I will call on the $L{\small ORD}$, _who_ _is_ worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. ^4

5 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; ^5

6 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; ^6

7 In my distress I called upon the $L{\small ORD}$, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry _did_ _enter_ into his ears. ^7

8 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth. ^8

9 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. ^9

10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness _was_ under his feet. ^10

11 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind. ^11

12 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, _and_ thick clouds of the skies. ^12

13 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled. ^13

14 The $L{\small ORD}$ thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. ^14

15 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them. ^15

16 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the $L{\small ORD}$, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. ^16

17 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; ^17

18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, _and_ from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me. ^18

19 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the $L{\small ORD}$ was my stay. ^19

20 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me. ^20

21 The $L{\small ORD}$ rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. ^21

22 For I have kept the ways of the $L{\small ORD}$, and have not wickedly departed from my God. ^22

23 For all his judgments _were_ before me: and _as_ _for_ his statutes, I did not depart from them. ^23

24 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. ^24

25 Therefore the $L{\small ORD}$ hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight. ^25

26 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, _and_ with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright. ^26

27 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. ^27

28 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes _are_ upon the haughty, _that_ thou mayest bring _them_ down. ^28

29 For thou _art_ my lamp, O $L{\small ORD}$: and the $L{\small ORD}$ will lighten my darkness. ^29

30 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. ^30

31 _As_ _for_ God, his way _is_ perfect; the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ tried: he _is_ a buckler to all them that trust in him. ^31

32 For who _is_ God, save the $L{\small ORD}$? and who _is_ a rock, save our God? ^32

33 God _is_ my strength _and_ power: and he maketh my way perfect. ^33

34 He maketh my feet like hinds' _feet:_ and setteth me upon my high places. ^34

35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. ^35

36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. ^36

37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. ^37

38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them. ^38

39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet. ^39

40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. ^40

41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. ^41

42 They looked, but _there_ _was_ none to save; _even_ unto the $L{\small ORD}$, but he answered them not. ^42

43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, _and_ did spread them abroad. ^43

44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me _to_ _be_ head of the heathen: a people _which_ I knew not shall serve me. ^44

45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. ^45

46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places. ^46

47 The $L{\small ORD}$ liveth; and blessed _be_ my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. ^47

48 It _is_ God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, ^48

49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. ^49

50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. ^50

51 _He_ _is_ the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore. ^51
