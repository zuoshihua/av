### 2 Samuel 15

1 AND it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. ^1

2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was _so_, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city _art_ thou? And he said, Thy servant _is_ of one of the tribes of Israel. ^2

3 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters _are_ good and right; but _there_ _is_ no man _deputed_ of the king to hear thee. ^3

4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! ^4

5 And it was _so_, that when any man came nigh _to_ _him_ to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. ^5

6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. ^6

7 ¶ And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the $L{\small ORD}$, in Hebron. ^7

8 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the $L{\small ORD}$ shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. ^9

10 ¶ But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. ^10

11 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, _that_ _were_ called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. ^11

12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counseller, from his city, _even_ from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. ^12

13 ¶ And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. ^13

14 And David said unto all his servants that _were_ with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not _else_ escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. ^14

15 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants _are_ _ready_ _to_ _do_ whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. ^15

16 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, _which_ _were_ concubines, to keep the house. ^16

17 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. ^17

18 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. ^18

19 ¶ Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou _art_ a stranger, and also an exile. ^19

20 Whereas thou camest _but_ yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth _be_ with thee. ^20

21 And Ittai answered the king, and said, _As_ the $L{\small ORD}$ liveth, and _as_ my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be. ^21

22 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that _were_ with him. ^22

23 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. ^23

24 ¶ And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites _were_ with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. ^24

25 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$, he will bring me again, and shew me _both_ it, and his habitation: ^25

26 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, _here_ _am_ I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. ^26

27 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, _Art_ _not_ thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. ^27

28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. ^28

29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there. ^29

30 ¶ And David went up by the ascent of _mount_ Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that _was_ with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. ^30

31 ¶ And _one_ told David, saying, Ahithophel _is_ among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O $L{\small ORD}$, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. ^31

32 ¶ And it came to pass, that _when_ David was come to the top _of_ _the_ _mount_, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: ^32

33 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: ^33

34 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; _as_ I _have_ _been_ thy father's servant hitherto, so _will_ I now also _be_ thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. ^34

35 And _hast_ _thou_ not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, _that_ what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell _it_ to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. ^35

36 Behold, _they_ _have_ there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's _son_, and Jonathan Abiathar's _son;_ and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear. ^36

37 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem. ^37
