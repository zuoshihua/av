### 2 Samuel 5

1 THEN came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we _are_ thy bone and thy flesh. ^1

2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the $L{\small ORD}$ said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. ^2

3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the $L{\small ORD}$: and they anointed David king over Israel. ^3

4 ¶ David _was_ thirty years old when he began to reign, _and_ he reigned forty years. ^4

5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah. ^5

6 ¶ And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither. ^6

7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same _is_ the city of David. ^7

8 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, _that_ _are_ hated of David's soul, _he_ _shall_ _be_ _chief_ _and_ _captain_. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. ^8

9 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. ^9

10 And David went on, and grew great, and the $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts _was_ with him. ^10

11 ¶ And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house. ^11

12 And David perceived that the $L{\small ORD}$ had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake. ^12

13 ¶ And David took _him_ more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. ^13

14 And these _be_ the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, ^14

15 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, ^15

16 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. ^16

17 ¶ But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard _of_ _it_, and went down to the hold. ^17

18 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. ^18

19 And David inquired of the $L{\small ORD}$, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. ^19

20 And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The $L{\small ORD}$ hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim. ^20

21 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them. ^21

22 ¶ And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. ^22

23 And when David inquired of the $L{\small ORD}$, he said, Thou shalt not go up; _but_ fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. ^23

24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the $L{\small ORD}$ go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines. ^24

25 And David did so, as the $L{\small ORD}$ had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer. ^25
