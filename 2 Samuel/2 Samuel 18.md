### 2 Samuel 18

1 AND David numbered the people that _were_ with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. ^1

2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. ^2

3 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now _thou_ _art_ worth ten thousand of us: therefore now _it_ _is_ better that thou succour us out of the city. ^3

4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. ^4

5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, _Deal_ gently for my sake with the young man, _even_ with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. ^5

6 ¶ So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; ^6

7 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand _men_. ^7

8 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. ^8

9 ¶ And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that _was_ under him went away. ^9

10 And a certain man saw _it_, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. ^10

11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest _him_, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten _shekels_ of silver, and a girdle. ^11

12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand _shekels_ of silver in mine hand, _yet_ would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none _touch_ the young man Absalom. ^12

13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against _me_. ^13

14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he _was_ yet alive in the midst of the oak. ^14

15 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. ^15

16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. ^16

17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. ^17

18 ¶ Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which _is_ in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place. ^18

19 ¶ Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath avenged him of his enemies. ^19

20 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. ^20

21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. ^21

22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? ^22

23 But howsoever, _said_ _he_, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi. ^23

24 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. ^24

25 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he _be_ alone, _there_ _is_ tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near. ^25

26 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold _another_ man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. ^26

27 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He _is_ a good man, and cometh with good tidings. ^27

28 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. ^28

29 And the king said, _Is_ the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and _me_ thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what _it_ _was_. ^29

30 And the king said _unto_ _him_, Turn aside, _and_ stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still. ^30

31 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. ^31

32 And the king said unto Cushi, _Is_ the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do _thee_ hurt, be as _that_ young man _is_. ^32

33 ¶ And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! ^33
