### Jonah 2

1 THEN Jonah prayed unto the $L{\small ORD}$ his God out of the fish's belly, ^1

2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, _and_ thou heardest my voice. ^2

3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. ^3

4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. ^4

5 The waters compassed me about, _even_ to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. ^5

6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars _was_ about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O $L{\small ORD}$ my God. ^6

7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the $L{\small ORD}$: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. ^7

8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. ^8

9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay _that_ that I have vowed. Salvation _is_ of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 Â¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry _land_. ^10
