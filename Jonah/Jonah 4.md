### Jonah 4

1 BUT it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. ^1

2 And he prayed unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, I pray thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, _was_ not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou _art_ a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. ^2

3 Therefore now, O $L{\small ORD}$, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for _it_ _is_ better for me to die than to live. ^3

4 Â¶ Then said the $L{\small ORD}$, Doest thou well to be angry? ^4

5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. ^5

6 And the $L{\small ORD}$ God prepared a gourd, and made _it_ to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. ^6

7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. ^7

8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, _It_ _is_ better for me to die than to live. ^8

9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, _even_ unto death. ^9

10 Then said the $L{\small ORD}$, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: ^10

11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and _also_ much cattle? ^11
