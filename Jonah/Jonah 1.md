### Jonah 1

1 NOW the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, ^1

2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. ^2

3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the $L{\small ORD}$, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 ¶ But the $L{\small ORD}$ sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. ^4

5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that _were_ in the ship into the sea, to lighten _it_ of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. ^5

6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not. ^6

7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil _is_ upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. ^7

8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil _is_ upon us; What _is_ thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what _is_ thy country? and of what people _art_ thou? ^8

9 And he said unto them, I _am_ an Hebrew; and I fear the $L{\small ORD}$, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry _land_. ^9

10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the $L{\small ORD}$, because he had told them. ^10

11 ¶ Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. ^11

12 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest _is_ upon you. ^12

13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring _it_ to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them. ^13

14 Wherefore they cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, We beseech thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, hast done as it pleased thee. ^14

15 So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging. ^15

16 Then the men feared the $L{\small ORD}$ exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and made vows. ^16

17 ¶ Now the $L{\small ORD}$ had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. ^17
