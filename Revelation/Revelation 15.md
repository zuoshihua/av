### Revelation 15

1 AND I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God. ^1

2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, _and_ over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. ^2

3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous _are_ thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true _are_ thy ways, thou King of saints. ^3

4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for _thou_ only _art_ holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest. ^4

5 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: ^5

6 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. ^6

7 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. ^7

8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. ^8
