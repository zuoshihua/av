### Nehemiah 5

1 AND there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. ^1

2 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, _are_ many: therefore we take up corn _for_ _them_, that we may eat, and live. ^2

3 _Some_ also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. ^3

4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, _and_ _that_ _upon_ our lands and vineyards. ^4

5 Yet now our flesh _is_ as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and _some_ of our daughters are brought unto bondage _already:_ neither _is_ _it_ in our power _to_ _redeem_ _them;_ for other men have our lands and vineyards. ^5

6 ¶ And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. ^6

7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them. ^7

8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing _to_ _answer_. ^8

9 Also I said, It _is_ not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? ^9

10 I likewise, _and_ my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury. ^10

11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth _part_ of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. ^11

12 Then said they, We will restore _them_, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. ^12

13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the $L{\small ORD}$. And the people did according to this promise. ^13

14 ¶ Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, _that_ _is_, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. ^14

15 But the former governors that _had_ _been_ before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. ^15

16 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants _were_ gathered thither unto the work. ^16

17 Moreover _there_ _were_ at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that _are_ about us. ^17

18 Now _that_ which was prepared _for_ _me_ daily _was_ one ox _and_ six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. ^18

19 Think upon me, my God, for good, _according_ to all that I have done for this people. ^19
