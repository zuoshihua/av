### 1 Kings 18

1 AND it came to pass _after_ many days, that the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. ^1

2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And _there_ _was_ a sore famine in Samaria. ^2

3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which _was_ the governor of _his_ house. (Now Obadiah feared the $L{\small ORD}$ greatly: ^3

4 For it was _so_, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the $L{\small ORD}$, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) ^4

5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. ^5

6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. ^6

7 ¶ And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, _Art_ thou that my lord Elijah? ^7

8 And he answered him, I _am:_ go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah _is_ _here_. ^8

9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? ^9

10 _As_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, _He_ _is_ not _there;_ he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. ^10

11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah _is_ _here_. ^11

12 And it shall come to pass, _as_ _soon_ _as_ I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall carry thee whither I know not; and _so_ when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the $L{\small ORD}$ from my youth. ^12

13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the $L{\small ORD}$, how I hid an hundred men of the $L{\small ORD}$'s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? ^13

14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah _is_ _here:_ and he shall slay me. ^14

15 And Elijah said, _As_ the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. ^15

16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah. ^16

17 ¶ And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, _Art_ thou he that troubleth Israel? ^17

18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the $L{\small ORD}$, and thou hast followed Baalim. ^18

19 Now therefore send, _and_ gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. ^19

20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. ^20

21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the $L{\small ORD}$ _be_ God, follow him: but if Baal, _then_ follow him. And the people answered him not a word. ^21

22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, _even_ I only, remain a prophet of the $L{\small ORD}$; but Baal's prophets _are_ four hundred and fifty men. ^22

23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay _it_ on wood, and put no fire _under:_ and I will dress the other bullock, and lay _it_ on wood, and put no fire _under:_ ^23

24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the $L{\small ORD}$: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. ^24

25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress _it_ first; for ye _are_ many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire _under_. ^25

26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed _it_, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But _there_ _was_ no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. ^26

27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he _is_ a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, _or_ peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. ^27

28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. ^28

29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the _time_ of the offering of the _evening_ sacrifice, that _there_ _was_ neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. ^29

30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the $L{\small ORD}$ _that_ _was_ broken down. ^30

31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: ^31

32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. ^32

33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid _him_ on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour _it_ on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. ^33

34 And he said, Do _it_ the second time. And they did _it_ the second time. And he said, Do _it_ the third time. And they did _it_ the third time. ^34

35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. ^35

36 And it came to pass at _the_ _time_ _of_ the offering of the _evening_ sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, $L{\small ORD}$ God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou _art_ God in Israel, and _that_ I _am_ thy servant, and _that_ I have done all these things at thy word. ^36

37 Hear me, O $L{\small ORD}$, hear me, that this people may know that thou _art_ the $L{\small ORD}$ God, and _that_ thou hast turned their heart back again. ^37

38 Then the fire of the $L{\small ORD}$ fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that _was_ in the trench. ^38

39 And when all the people saw _it_, they fell on their faces: and they said, The $L{\small ORD}$, he _is_ the God; the $L{\small ORD}$, he _is_ the God. ^39

40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. ^40

41 ¶ And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for _there_ _is_ a sound of abundance of rain. ^41

42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, ^42

43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, _There_ _is_ nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. ^43

44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare _thy_ _chariot_, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. ^44

45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. ^45

46 And the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. ^46
