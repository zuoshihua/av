### 1 Kings 15

1 NOW in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah. ^1

2 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name _was_ Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. ^2

3 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the $L{\small ORD}$ his God, as the heart of David his father. ^3

4 Nevertheless for David's sake did the $L{\small ORD}$ his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem: ^4

5 Because David did _that_ _which_ _was_ right in the eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$, and turned not aside from any _thing_ that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. ^5

6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. ^6

7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, _are_ they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. ^7

8 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. ^8

9 ¶ And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah. ^9

10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name _was_ Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. ^10

11 And Asa did _that_ _which_ _was_ right in the eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$, as _did_ David his father. ^11

12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. ^12

13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from _being_ queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt _it_ by the brook Kidron. ^13

14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the $L{\small ORD}$ all his days. ^14

15 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, silver, and gold, and vessels. ^15

16 ¶ And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. ^16

17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. ^17

18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold _that_ _were_ left in the treasures of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, ^18

19 _There_ _is_ a league between me and thee, _and_ between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. ^19

20 So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. ^20

21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard _thereof_, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. ^21

22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none _was_ exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. ^22

23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, _are_ they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. ^23

24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. ^24

25 ¶ And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. ^25

26 And he did evil in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. ^26

27 ¶ And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which _belonged_ to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. ^27

28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. ^28

29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, _that_ he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the $L{\small ORD}$, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: ^29

30 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel to anger. ^30

31 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, _are_ they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? ^31

32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. ^32

33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. ^33

34 And he did evil in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. ^34
