### 1 Kings 7

1 BUT Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. ^1

2 ¶ He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof _was_ an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. ^2

3 And _it_ _was_ covered with cedar above upon the beams, that _lay_ on forty five pillars, fifteen _in_ a row. ^3

4 And _there_ _were_ windows _in_ three rows, and light _was_ against light _in_ three ranks. ^4

5 And all the doors and posts _were_ square, with the windows: and light _was_ against light _in_ three ranks. ^5

6 ¶ And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof _was_ fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch _was_ before them: and the _other_ pillars and the thick beam _were_ before them. ^6

7 ¶ Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, _even_ the porch of judgment: and _it_ _was_ covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other. ^7

8 ¶ And his house where he dwelt _had_ another court within the porch, _which_ was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken _to_ _wife_, like unto this porch. ^8

9 All these _were_ _of_ costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and _so_ on the outside toward the great court. ^9

10 And the foundation _was_ _of_ costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. ^10

11 And above _were_ costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars. ^11

12 And the great court round about _was_ with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and for the porch of the house. ^12

13 ¶ And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. ^13

14 He _was_ a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father _was_ a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. ^14

15 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. ^15

16 And he made two chapiters _of_ molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter _was_ five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter _was_ five cubits: ^16

17 _And_ nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which _were_ upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. ^17

18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that _were_ upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. ^18

19 And the chapiters that _were_ upon the top of the pillars _were_ of lily work in the porch, four cubits. ^19

20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars _had_ _pomegranates_ also above, over against the belly which _was_ by the network: and the pomegranates _were_ two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter. ^20

21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. ^21

22 And upon the top of the pillars _was_ lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished. ^22

23 ¶ And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: _it_ _was_ round all about, and his height _was_ five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. ^23

24 And under the brim of it round about _there_ _were_ knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops _were_ cast in two rows, when it was cast. ^24

25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea _was_ _set_ above upon them, and all their hinder parts _were_ inward. ^25

26 And it _was_ an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. ^26

27 ¶ And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits _was_ the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. ^27

28 And the work of the bases _was_ on this _manner:_ they had borders, and the borders _were_ between the ledges: ^28

29 And on the borders that _were_ between the ledges _were_ lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges _there_ _was_ a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen _were_ certain additions made of thin work. ^29

30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver _were_ undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. ^30

31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above _was_ a cubit: but the mouth thereof _was_ round _after_ the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it _were_ gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. ^31

32 And under the borders _were_ four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels _were_ _joined_ to the base: and the height of a wheel _was_ a cubit and half a cubit. ^32

33 And the work of the wheels _was_ like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, _were_ all molten. ^33

34 And _there_ _were_ four undersetters to the four corners of one base: _and_ the undersetters _were_ of the very base itself. ^34

35 And in the top of the base _was_ _there_ a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof _were_ of the same. ^35

36 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about. ^36

37 After this _manner_ he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, _and_ one size. ^37

38 ¶ Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: _and_ every laver was four cubits: _and_ upon every one of the ten bases one laver. ^38

39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. ^39

40 ¶ And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the $L{\small ORD}$: ^40

41 The two pillars, and the _two_ bowls of the chapiters that _were_ on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which _were_ upon the top of the pillars; ^41

42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, _even_ two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that _were_ upon the pillars; ^42

43 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; ^43

44 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; ^44

45 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, _were_ _of_ bright brass. ^45

46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. ^46

47 And Solomon left all the vessels _unweighed_, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out. ^47

48 And Solomon made all the vessels that _pertained_ unto the house of the $L{\small ORD}$: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread _was_, ^48

49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right _side_, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs _of_ gold, ^49

50 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers _of_ pure gold; and the hinges _of_ gold, _both_ for the doors of the inner house, the most holy _place_, _and_ for the doors of the house, _to_ _wit_, of the temple. ^50

51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; _even_ the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^51
