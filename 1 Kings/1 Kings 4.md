### 1 Kings 4

1 SO king Solomon was king over all Israel. ^1

2 And these _were_ the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, ^2

3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. ^3

4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada _was_ over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar _were_ the priests: ^4

5 And Azariah the son of Nathan _was_ over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan _was_ principal officer, _and_ the king's friend: ^5

6 And Ahishar _was_ over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda _was_ over the tribute. ^6

7 ¶ And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. ^7

8 And these _are_ their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: ^8

9 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: ^9

10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him _pertained_ Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: ^10

11 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: ^11

12 Baana the son of Ahilud; _to_ _him_ _pertained_ Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which _is_ by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, _even_ unto _the_ _place_ _that_ _is_ beyond Jokneam: ^12

13 The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him _pertained_ the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which _are_ in Gilead; to him _also_ _pertained_ the region of Argob, which _is_ in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: ^13

14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo _had_ Mahanaim: ^14

15 Ahimaaz _was_ in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife: ^15

16 Baanah the son of Hushai _was_ in Asher and in Aloth: ^16

17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: ^17

18 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: ^18

19 Geber the son of Uri _was_ in the country of Gilead, _in_ the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and _he_ _was_ the only officer which _was_ in the land. ^19

20 ¶ Judah and Israel _were_ many, as the sand which _is_ by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. ^20

21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. ^21

22 ¶ And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ^22

23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. ^23

24 For he had dominion over all _the_ _region_ on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. ^24

25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. ^25

26 ¶ And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. ^26

27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. ^27

28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where _the_ _officers_ were, every man according to his charge. ^28

29 ¶ And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that _is_ on the sea shore. ^29

30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. ^30

31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. ^31

32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. ^32

33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that _is_ in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. ^33

34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. ^34
