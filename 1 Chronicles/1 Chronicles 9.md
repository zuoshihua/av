### 1 Chronicles 9

1 SO all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they _were_ written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, _who_ were carried away to Babylon for their transgression. ^1

2 ¶ Now the first inhabitants that _dwelt_ in their possessions in their cities _were_, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims. ^2

3 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh; ^3

4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah. ^4

5 And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons. ^5

6 And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred and ninety. ^6

7 And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah, ^7

8 And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah; ^8

9 And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men _were_ chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers. ^9

10 ¶ And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin, ^10

11 And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God; ^11

12 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer; ^12

13 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God. ^13

14 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; ^14

15 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph; ^15

16 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites. ^16

17 And the porters _were_, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum _was_ the chief; ^17

18 Who hitherto _waited_ in the king's gate eastward: they _were_ porters in the companies of the children of Levi. ^18

19 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, _were_ over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, _being_ over the host of the $L{\small ORD}$, _were_ keepers of the entry. ^19

20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, _and_ the $L{\small ORD}$ _was_ with him. ^20

21 _And_ Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah _was_ porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. ^21

22 All these _which_ _were_ chosen to be porters in the gates _were_ two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office. ^22

23 So they and their children _had_ the oversight of the gates of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, _namely_, the house of the tabernacle, by wards. ^23

24 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. ^24

25 And their brethren, _which_ _were_ in their villages, _were_ to come after seven days from time to time with them. ^25

26 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in _their_ set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. ^26

27 ¶ And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge _was_ upon them, and the opening thereof every morning _pertained_ to them. ^27

28 And _certain_ of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale. ^28

29 _Some_ of them also _were_ appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices. ^29

30 And _some_ of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. ^30

31 And Mattithiah, _one_ of the Levites, who _was_ the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans. ^31

32 And _other_ of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, _were_ over the shewbread, to prepare _it_ every sabbath. ^32

33 And these _are_ the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, _who_ _remaining_ in the chambers _were_ free: for they were employed in _that_ work day and night. ^33

34 These chief fathers of the Levites _were_ chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem. ^34

35 ¶ And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name _was_ Maachah: ^35

36 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab, ^36

37 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. ^37

38 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren. ^38

39 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal. ^39

40 And the son of Jonathan _was_ Merib-baal: and Merib-baal begat Micah. ^40

41 And the sons of Micah _were_, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, _and_ _Ahaz_. ^41

42 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza; ^42

43 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. ^43

44 And Azel had six sons, whose names _are_ these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these _were_ the sons of Azel. ^44
