### 1 Chronicles 13

1 AND David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, _and_ with every leader. ^1

2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If _it_ _seem_ good unto you, and _that_ _it_ _be_ of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, _that_ _are_ left in all the land of Israel, and with them _also_ to the priests and Levites _which_ _are_ in their cities _and_ suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: ^2

3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. ^3

4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. ^4

5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim. ^5

6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, _that_ _is_, to Kirjath-jearim, which _belonged_ to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the $L{\small ORD}$, that dwelleth _between_ the cherubims, whose name is called _on_ _it_. ^6

7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. ^7

8 And David and all Israel played before God with all _their_ might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. ^8

9 Â¶ And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. ^9

10 And the anger of the $L{\small ORD}$ was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. ^10

11 And David was displeased, because the $L{\small ORD}$ had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day. ^11

12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God _home_ to me? ^12

13 So David brought not the ark _home_ to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. ^13

14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the $L{\small ORD}$ blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had. ^14
