### 1 Chronicles 23

1 SO when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. ^1

2 ¶ And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. ^2

3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. ^3

4 Of which, twenty and four thousand _were_ to set forward the work of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$; and six thousand _were_ officers and judges: ^4

5 Moreover four thousand _were_ porters; and four thousand praised the $L{\small ORD}$ with the instruments which I made, _said_ _David_, to praise _therewith_. ^5

6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, _namely_, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. ^6

7 ¶ Of the Gershonites _were_, Laadan, and Shimei. ^7

8 The sons of Laadan; the chief _was_ Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. ^8

9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These _were_ the chief of the fathers of Laadan. ^9

10 And the sons of Shimei _were_, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four _were_ the sons of Shimei. ^10

11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to _their_ father's house. ^11

12 ¶ The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. ^12

13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the $L{\small ORD}$, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. ^13

14 Now _concerning_ Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. ^14

15 The sons of Moses _were_, Gershom, and Eliezer. ^15

16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel _was_ the chief. ^16

17 And the sons of Eliezer _were_, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. ^17

18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. ^18

19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. ^19

20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second. ^20

21 ¶ The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. ^21

22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them. ^22

23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. ^23

24 ¶ These _were_ the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; _even_ the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, from the age of twenty years and upward. ^24

25 For David said, The $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: ^25

26 And also unto the Levites; they shall no _more_ carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof. ^26

27 For by the last words of David the Levites _were_ numbered from twenty years old and above: ^27

28 Because their office _was_ to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; ^28

29 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for _that_ _which_ _is_ _baked_ _in_ the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; ^29

30 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the $L{\small ORD}$, and likewise at even; ^30

31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the $L{\small ORD}$ in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the $L{\small ORD}$: ^31

32 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy _place_, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^32
