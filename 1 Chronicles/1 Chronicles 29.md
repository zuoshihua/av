### 1 Chronicles 29

1 FURTHERMORE David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, _is_ _yet_ young and tender, and the work _is_ great: for the palace _is_ not for man, but for the $L{\small ORD}$ God. ^1

2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for _things_ _to_ _be_ _made_ of gold, and the silver for _things_ of silver, and the brass for _things_ of brass, the iron for _things_ of iron, and wood for _things_ of wood; onyx stones, and _stones_ to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. ^2

3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, _which_ I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, ^3

4 _Even_ three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses _withal:_ ^4

5 The gold for _things_ of gold, and the silver for _things_ of silver, and for all manner of work _to_ _be_ _made_ by the hands of artificers. And who _then_ is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the $L{\small ORD}$? ^5

6 ¶ Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly, ^6

7 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. ^7

8 And they with whom _precious_ stones were found gave _them_ to the treasure of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. ^8

9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the $L{\small ORD}$: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. ^9

10 ¶ Wherefore David blessed the $L{\small ORD}$ before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed _be_ thou, $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. ^10

11 Thine, O $L{\small ORD}$, _is_ the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all _that_ _is_ in the heaven and in the earth _is_ _thine;_ thine _is_ the kingdom, O $L{\small ORD}$, and thou art exalted as head above all. ^11

12 Both riches and honour _come_ of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand _is_ power and might; and in thine hand _it_ _is_ to make great, and to give strength unto all. ^12

13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. ^13

14 But who _am_ I, and what _is_ my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things _come_ of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. ^14

15 For we _are_ strangers before thee, and sojourners, as _were_ all our fathers: our days on the earth _are_ as a shadow, and _there_ _is_ none abiding. ^15

16 O $L{\small ORD}$ our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name _cometh_ of thine hand, and _is_ all thine own. ^16

17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee. ^17

18 O $L{\small ORD}$ God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee: ^18

19 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all _these_ _things_, and to build the palace, _for_ the which I have made provision. ^19

20 ¶ And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. And all the congregation blessed the $L{\small ORD}$ God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the $L{\small ORD}$, and the king. ^20

21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and offered burnt offerings unto the $L{\small ORD}$, on the morrow after that day, _even_ a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, _and_ a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: ^21

22 And did eat and drink before the $L{\small ORD}$ on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed _him_ unto the $L{\small ORD}$ _to_ _be_ the chief governor, and Zadok _to_ _be_ priest. ^22

23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the $L{\small ORD}$ as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. ^23

24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. ^24

25 And the $L{\small ORD}$ magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him _such_ royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. ^25

26 ¶ Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. ^26

27 And the time that he reigned over Israel _was_ forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three _years_ reigned he in Jerusalem. ^27

28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. ^28

29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they _are_ written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, ^29

30 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries. ^30
