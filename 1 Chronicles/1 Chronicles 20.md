### 1 Chronicles 20

1 AND it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out _to_ _battle_, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. ^1

2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and _there_ _were_ precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city. ^2

3 And he brought out the people that _were_ in it, and cut _them_ with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. ^3

4 Â¶ And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, _that_ _was_ of the children of the giant: and they were subdued. ^4

5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff _was_ like a weaver's beam. ^5

6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of _great_ stature, whose fingers and toes _were_ four and twenty, six _on_ _each_ _hand_, and six _on_ _each_ _foot:_ and he also was the son of the giant. ^6

7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him. ^7

8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. ^8
