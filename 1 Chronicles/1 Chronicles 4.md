4 And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah. These _are_ the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, the father of Beth-lehem. ^4

9 ¶ And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. ^9

10 And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep _me_ from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested. ^10

13 And the sons of Kenaz; Othniel, and Seraiah: and the sons of Othniel; Hathath. ^13

14 And Meonothai begat Ophrah: and Seraiah begat Joab, the father of the valley of Charashim; for they were craftsmen. ^14

15 And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; Iru, Elah, and Naam: and the sons of Elah, even Kenaz. ^15

18 And his wife Jehudijah bare Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah. And these _are_ the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, which Mered took. ^18

22 And Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubi-lehem. And _these_ _are_ ancient things. ^22

23 These _were_ the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work. ^23

24 ¶ The sons of Simeon _were_, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, _and_ Shaul: ^24

25 Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son. ^25

26 And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, Shimei his son. ^26

27 And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brethren had not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children of Judah. ^27

28 And they dwelt at Beer-sheba, and Moladah, and Hazar-shual, ^28

29 And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad, ^29

30 And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag, ^30

31 And at Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susim, and at Beth-birei, and at Shaaraim. These _were_ their cities unto the reign of David. ^31

32 And their villages _were_, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan, five cities: ^32

33 And all their villages that _were_ round about the same cities, unto Baal. These _were_ their habitations, and their genealogy. ^33

34 And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah, ^34

38 These mentioned by _their_ names _were_ princes in their families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly. ^38

39 ¶ And they went to the entrance of Gedor, _even_ unto the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. ^39

40 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land _was_ wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for _they_ of Ham had dwelt there of old. ^40

41 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because _there_ _was_ pasture there for their flocks. ^41

42 And _some_ of them, _even_ of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. ^42

43 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and dwelt there unto this day. ^43
