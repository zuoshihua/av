### 1 Chronicles 22

1 THEN David said, This _is_ the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ God, and this _is_ the altar of the burnt offering for Israel. ^1

2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that _were_ in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. ^2

3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; ^3

4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. ^4

5 And David said, Solomon my son _is_ young and tender, and the house _that_ _is_ to be builded for the $L{\small ORD}$ _must_ _be_ exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will _therefore_ now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death. ^5

6 ¶ Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel. ^6

7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ my God: ^7

8 But the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. ^8

9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. ^9

10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I _will_ _be_ his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. ^10

11 Now, my son, the $L{\small ORD}$ be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, as he hath said of thee. ^11

12 Only the $L{\small ORD}$ give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God. ^12

13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the $L{\small ORD}$ charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. ^13

14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto. ^14

15 Moreover _there_ _are_ workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work. ^15

16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, _there_ _is_ no number. Arise _therefore_, and be doing, and the $L{\small ORD}$ be with thee. ^16

17 ¶ David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, _saying_, ^17

18 _Is_ not the $L{\small ORD}$ your God with you? and hath he _not_ given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the $L{\small ORD}$, and before his people. ^18

19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the $L{\small ORD}$ your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the $L{\small ORD}$ God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^19
