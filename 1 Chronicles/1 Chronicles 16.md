### 1 Chronicles 16

1 SO they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. ^1

2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^2

3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon _of_ _wine_. ^3

4 ¶ And he appointed _certain_ of the Levites to minister before the ark of the $L{\small ORD}$, and to record, and to thank and praise the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel: ^4

5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; ^5

6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. ^6

7 ¶ Then on that day David delivered first _this_ _psalm_ to thank the $L{\small ORD}$ into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. ^7

8 Give thanks unto the $L{\small ORD}$, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. ^8

9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. ^9

10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 Seek the $L{\small ORD}$ and his strength, seek his face continually. ^11

12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; ^12

13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. ^13

14 He _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$ our God; his judgments _are_ in all the earth. ^14

15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word _which_ he commanded to a thousand generations; ^15

16 _Even_ _of_ _the_ _covenant_ which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; ^16

17 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, _and_ to Israel _for_ an everlasting covenant, ^17

18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; ^18

19 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. ^19

20 And _when_ they went from nation to nation, and from _one_ kingdom to another people; ^20

21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, ^21

22 _Saying_, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. ^22

23 Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. ^23

24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations. ^24

25 For great _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$, and greatly to be praised: he also _is_ to be feared above all gods. ^25

26 For all the gods of the people _are_ idols: but the $L{\small ORD}$ made the heavens. ^26

27 Glory and honour _are_ in his presence; strength and gladness _are_ in his place. ^27

28 Give unto the $L{\small ORD}$, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the $L{\small ORD}$ glory and strength. ^28

29 Give unto the $L{\small ORD}$ the glory _due_ unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the $L{\small ORD}$ in the beauty of holiness. ^29

30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. ^30

31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let _men_ say among the nations, The $L{\small ORD}$ reigneth. ^31

32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that _is_ therein. ^32

33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the $L{\small ORD}$, because he cometh to judge the earth. ^33

34 O give thanks unto the $L{\small ORD}$; for _he_ _is_ good; for his mercy _endureth_ for ever. ^34

35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, _and_ glory in thy praise. ^35

36 Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the $L{\small ORD}$. ^36

37 ¶ So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: ^37

38 And Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah _to_ _be_ porters: ^38

39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the $L{\small ORD}$ in the high place that _was_ at Gibeon, ^39

40 To offer burnt offerings unto the $L{\small ORD}$ upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and _to_ _do_ according to all that is written in the law of the $L{\small ORD}$, which he commanded Israel; ^40

41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the $L{\small ORD}$, because his mercy _endureth_ for ever; ^41

42 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun _were_ porters. ^42

43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. ^43
