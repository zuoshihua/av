### 1 Chronicles 15

1 AND _David_ made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. ^1

2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the $L{\small ORD}$ chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. ^2

3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the $L{\small ORD}$ unto his place, which he had prepared for it. ^3

4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: ^4

5 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: ^5

6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: ^6

7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: ^7

8 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: ^8

9 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: ^9

10 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. ^10

11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, ^11

12 And said unto them, Ye _are_ the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, _both_ ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel unto _the_ _place_ _that_ I have prepared for it. ^12

13 For because ye _did_ _it_ not at the first, the $L{\small ORD}$ our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. ^13

14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel. ^14

15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^15

16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren _to_ _be_ the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. ^16

17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; ^17

18 And with them their brethren of the second _degree_, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters. ^18

19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, _were_ _appointed_ to sound with cymbals of brass; ^19

20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; ^20

21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. ^21

22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, _was_ for song: he instructed about the song, because he _was_ skilful. ^22

23 And Berechiah and Elkanah _were_ doorkeepers for the ark. ^23

24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah _were_ doorkeepers for the ark. ^24

25 ¶ So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. ^25

26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. ^26

27 And David _was_ clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also _had_ upon him an ephod of linen. ^27

28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. ^28

29 ¶ And it came to pass, _as_ the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. ^29
