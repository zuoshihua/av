### 1 Chronicles 14

1 NOW Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. ^1

2 And David perceived that the $L{\small ORD}$ had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. ^2

3 ¶ And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. ^3

4 Now these _are_ the names of _his_ children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, ^4

5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, ^5

6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, ^6

7 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. ^7

8 ¶ And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard _of_ _it_, and went out against them. ^8

9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. ^9

10 And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. ^10

11 So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. ^11

12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. ^12

13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. ^13

14 Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. ^14

15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, _that_ then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. ^15

16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. ^16

17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the $L{\small ORD}$ brought the fear of him upon all nations. ^17
