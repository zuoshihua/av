### 1 Chronicles 17

1 NOW it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ _remaineth_ under curtains. ^1

2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that _is_ in thine heart; for God _is_ with thee. ^2

3 ¶ And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, ^3

4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: ^4

5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from _one_ tabernacle _to_ _another_. ^5

6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? ^6

7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, _even_ from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: ^7

8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that _are_ in the earth. ^8

9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, ^9

10 And since the time that I commanded judges _to_ _be_ over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the $L{\small ORD}$ will build thee an house. ^10

11 ¶ And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go _to_ _be_ with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. ^11

12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. ^12

13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took _it_ from _him_ that was before thee: ^13

14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. ^14

15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. ^15

16 ¶ And David the king came and sat before the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, Who _am_ I, O $L{\small ORD}$ God, and what _is_ mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? ^16

17 And _yet_ this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast _also_ spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O $L{\small ORD}$ God. ^17

18 What can David _speak_ more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. ^18

19 O $L{\small ORD}$, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all _these_ great things. ^19

20 O $L{\small ORD}$, _there_ _is_ none like thee, neither _is_ _there_ _any_ God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. ^20

21 And what one nation in the earth _is_ like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem _to_ _be_ his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? ^21

22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, $L{\small ORD}$, becamest their God. ^22

23 Therefore now, $L{\small ORD}$, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. ^23

24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ the God of Israel, _even_ a God to Israel: and _let_ the house of David thy servant _be_ established before thee. ^24

25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found _in_ _his_ _heart_ to pray before thee. ^25

26 And now, $L{\small ORD}$, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: ^26

27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O $L{\small ORD}$, and _it_ _shall_ _be_ blessed for ever. ^27
