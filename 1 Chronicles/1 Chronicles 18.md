### 1 Chronicles 18

1 NOW after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. ^1

2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, _and_ brought gifts. ^2

3 ¶ And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. ^3

4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot _horses_, but reserved of them an hundred chariots. ^4

5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. ^5

6 Then David put _garrisons_ in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, _and_ brought gifts. Thus the $L{\small ORD}$ preserved David whithersoever he went. ^6

7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. ^7

8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. ^8

9 ¶ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; ^9

10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and _with_ _him_ all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. ^10

11 ¶ Them also king David dedicated unto the $L{\small ORD}$, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all _these_ nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. ^11

12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. ^12

13 ¶ And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the $L{\small ORD}$ preserved David whithersoever he went. ^13

14 ¶ So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. ^14

15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah _was_ over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. ^15

16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, _were_ the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; ^16

17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada _was_ over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David _were_ chief about the king. ^17
