### 2 Corinthians 11

1 WOULD to God ye could bear with me a little in _my_ folly: and indeed bear with me. ^1

2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present _you_ _as_ a chaste virgin to Christ. ^2

3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. ^3

4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or _if_ ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with _him_. ^4

5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. ^5

6 But though _I_ _be_ rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. ^6

7 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? ^7

8 I robbed other churches, taking wages _of_ _them_, to do you service. ^8

9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all _things_ I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and _so_ will I keep _myself_. ^9

10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. ^10

11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. ^11

12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. ^12

13 For such _are_ false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. ^13

14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. ^14

15 Therefore _it_ _is_ no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. ^15

16 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. ^16

17 That which I speak, I speak _it_ not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. ^17

18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. ^18

19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye _yourselves_ are wise. ^19

20 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour _you_, if a man take _of_ _you_, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. ^20

21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. ^21

22 Are they Hebrews? so _am_ I. Are they Israelites? so _am_ I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so _am_ I. ^22

23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I _am_ more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. ^23

24 Of the Jews five times received I forty _stripes_ save one. ^24

25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; ^25

26 _In_ journeyings often, _in_ perils of waters, _in_ perils of robbers, _in_ perils by _mine_ _own_ countrymen, _in_ perils by the heathen, _in_ perils in the city, _in_ perils in the wilderness, _in_ perils in the sea, _in_ perils among false brethren; ^26

27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. ^27

28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. ^28

29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? ^29

30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. ^30

31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. ^31

32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: ^32

33 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands. ^33
