### 2 Corinthians 3

1 DO we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some _others_, epistles of commendation to you, or _letters_ of commendation from you? ^1

2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: ^2

3 _Forasmuch_ _as_ _ye_ _are_ manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. ^3

4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: ^4

5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency _is_ of God; ^5

6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. ^6

7 But if the ministration of death, written _and_ engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which _glory_ was to be done away: ^7

8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? ^8

9 For if the ministration of condemnation _be_ glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. ^9

10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. ^10

11 For if that which is done away _was_ glorious, much more that which remaineth _is_ glorious. ^11

12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: ^12

13 And not as Moses, _which_ put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: ^13

14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which _vail_ is done away in Christ. ^14

15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. ^15

16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. ^16

17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord _is_, there _is_ liberty. ^17

18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, _even_ as by the Spirit of the Lord. ^18
