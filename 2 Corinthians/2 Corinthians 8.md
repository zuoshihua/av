### 2 Corinthians 8

1 MOREOVER, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; ^1

2 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. ^2

3 For to _their_ power, I bear record, yea, and beyond _their_ power _they_ _were_ willing of themselves; ^3

4 Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and _take_ _upon_ _us_ the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. ^4

5 And _this_ _they_ _did_, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. ^5

6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. ^6

7 Therefore, as ye abound in every _thing_, _in_ faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and _in_ all diligence, and _in_ your love to us, _see_ that ye abound in this grace also. ^7

8 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. ^8

9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. ^9

10 And herein I give _my_ advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. ^10

11 Now therefore perform the doing _of_ _it;_ that as _there_ _was_ a readiness to will, so _there_ _may_ _be_ a performance also out of that which ye have. ^11

12 For if there be first a willing mind, _it_ _is_ accepted according to that a man hath, _and_ not according to that he hath not. ^12

13 For _I_ _mean_ not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: ^13

14 But by an equality, _that_ now at this time your abundance _may_ _be_ _a_ _supply_ for their want, that their abundance also may be _a_ _supply_ for your want: that there may be equality: ^14

15 As it is written, He that _had_ _gathered_ much had nothing over; and he that _had_ _gathered_ little had no lack. ^15

16 But thanks _be_ to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. ^16

17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. ^17

18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise _is_ in the gospel throughout all the churches; ^18

19 And not _that_ only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and _declaration_ _of_ your ready mind: ^19

20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: ^20

21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. ^21

22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which _I_ _have_ in you. ^22

23 Whether _any_ _do_ _inquire_ of Titus, _he_ _is_ my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren _be_ _inquired_ _of_, _they_ _are_ the messengers of the churches, _and_ the glory of Christ. ^23

24 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. ^24
