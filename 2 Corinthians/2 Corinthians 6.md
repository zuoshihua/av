### 2 Corinthians 6

1 WE then, _as_ workers together _with_ _him_, beseech _you_ also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. ^1

2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now _is_ the accepted time; behold, now _is_ the day of salvation.) ^2

3 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: ^3

4 But in all _things_ approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, ^4

5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; ^5

6 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, ^6

7 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, ^7

8 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and _yet_ true; ^8

9 As unknown, and _yet_ well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; ^9

10 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and _yet_ possessing all things. ^10

11 O _ye_ Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. ^11

12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. ^12

13 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto _my_ children,) be ye also enlarged. ^13

14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? ^14

15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? ^15

16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in _them;_ and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. ^16

17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean _thing;_ and I will receive you, ^17

18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. ^18
