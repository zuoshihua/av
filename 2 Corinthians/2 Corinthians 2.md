### 2 Corinthians 2

1 BUT I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. ^1

2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? ^2

3 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is _the_ _joy_ of you all. ^3

4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. ^4

5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. ^5

6 Sufficient to such a man _is_ this punishment, which _was_ _inflicted_ of many. ^6

7 So that contrariwise ye _ought_ rather to forgive _him_, and comfort _him_, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. ^7

8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm _your_ love toward him. ^8

9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. ^9

10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I _forgive_ also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave _it_, for your sakes _forgave_ _I_ _it_ in the person of Christ; ^10

11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. ^11

12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to _preach_ Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, ^12

13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. ^13

14 Now thanks _be_ unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. ^14

15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: ^15

16 To the one _we_ _are_ the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who _is_ sufficient for these things? ^16

17 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. ^17
