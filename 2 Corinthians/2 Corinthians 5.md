### 2 Corinthians 5

1 FOR we know that if our earthly house of _this_ tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. ^1

2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: ^2

3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. ^3

4 For we that are in _this_ tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. ^4

5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing _is_ God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. ^5

6 Therefore _we_ _are_ always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: ^6

7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) ^7

8 We are confident, _I_ _say_, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. ^8

9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. ^9

10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things _done_ in _his_ body, according to that he hath done, whether _it_ _be_ good or bad. ^10

11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. ^11

12 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to _answer_ them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. ^12

13 For whether we be beside ourselves, _it_ _is_ to God: or whether we be sober, _it_ _is_ for your cause. ^13

14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: ^14

15 And _that_ he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. ^15

16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we _him_ no more. ^16

17 Therefore if any man _be_ in Christ, _he_ _is_ a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. ^17

18 And all things _are_ of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; ^18

19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. ^19

20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech _you_ by us: we pray _you_ in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. ^20

21 For he hath made him _to_ _be_ sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. ^21
