### 2 Corinthians 10

1 NOW I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence _am_ base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: ^1

2 But I beseech _you_, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. ^2

3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: ^3

4 (For the weapons of our warfare _are_ not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) ^4

5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; ^5

6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. ^6

7 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he _is_ Christ's, even so _are_ we Christ's. ^7

8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: ^8

9 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. ^9

10 For _his_ letters, say they, _are_ weighty and powerful; but _his_ bodily presence _is_ weak, and _his_ speech contemptible. ^10

11 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such _will_ _we_ _be_ also in deed when we are present. ^11

12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. ^12

13 But we will not boast of things without _our_ measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. ^13

14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond _our_ _measure_, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in _preaching_ the gospel of Christ: ^14

15 Not boasting of things without _our_ measure, _that_ _is_, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, ^15

16 To preach the gospel in the _regions_ beyond you, _and_ not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. ^16

17 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. ^17

18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. ^18
