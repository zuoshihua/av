### Amos 4

1 HEAR this word, ye kine of Bashan, that _are_ in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink. ^1

2 The Lord $G{\small OD}$ hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks. ^2

3 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every _cow_ _at_ _that_ _which_ _is_ before her; and ye shall cast _them_ into the palace, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 ¶ Come to Beth-el, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, _and_ your tithes after three years: ^4

5 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim _and_ publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^5

6 ¶ And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when _there_ _were_ yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. ^7

8 So two _or_ three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured _them:_ yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 I have overthrown _some_ of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^11

12 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: _and_ because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. ^12

13 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what _is_ his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The $L{\small ORD}$, The God of hosts, _is_ his name. ^13
