### Amos 2

1 THUS saith the $L{\small ORD}$; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away _the_ _punishment_ thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: ^1

2 But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, _and_ with the sound of the trumpet: ^2

3 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away _the_ _punishment_ thereof; because they have despised the law of the $L{\small ORD}$, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked: ^4

5 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. ^5

6 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away _the_ _punishment_ thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; ^6

7 That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the _same_ maid, to profane my holy name: ^7

8 And they lay _themselves_ down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned _in_ the house of their god. ^8

9 ¶ Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height _was_ like the height of the cedars, and he _was_ strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. ^9

10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. ^10

11 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. _Is_ _it_ not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^11

12 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. ^12

13 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed _that_ _is_ full of sheaves. ^13

14 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: ^14

15 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and _he_ _that_ _is_ swift of foot shall not deliver _himself:_ neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself. ^15

16 And _he_ _that_ _is_ courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16
