### Amos 5

1 HEAR ye this word which I take up against you, _even_ a lamentation, O house of Israel. ^1

2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; _there_ _is_ none to raise her up. ^2

3 For thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; The city that went out _by_ a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth _by_ an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel. ^3

4 ¶ For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live: ^4

5 But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought. ^5

6 Seek the $L{\small ORD}$, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour _it_, and _there_ _be_ none to quench _it_ in Beth-el. ^6

7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, ^7

8 _Seek_ _him_ that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ his name: ^8

9 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress. ^9

10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. ^10

11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading _is_ upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. ^11

12 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate _from_ _their_ _right_. ^12

13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it _is_ an evil time. ^13

14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the $L{\small ORD}$, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken. ^14

15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. ^15

16 Therefore the $L{\small ORD}$, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing _shall_ _be_ in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. ^16

17 And in all vineyards _shall_ _be_ wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 Woe unto you that desire the day of the $L{\small ORD}$! to what end _is_ it for you? the day of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ darkness, and not light. ^18

19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. ^19

20 _Shall_ not the day of the $L{\small ORD}$ _be_ darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it? ^20

21 ¶ I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. ^21

22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept _them:_ neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. ^22

23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. ^23

24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream. ^24

25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? ^25

26 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. ^26

27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, whose name _is_ The God of hosts. ^27
