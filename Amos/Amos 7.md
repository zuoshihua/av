### Amos 7

1 THUS hath the Lord $G{\small OD}$ shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, _it_ _was_ the latter growth after the king's mowings. ^1

2 And it came to pass, _that_ when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord $G{\small OD}$, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he _is_ small. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ repented for this: It shall not be, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 ¶ Thus hath the Lord $G{\small OD}$ shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord $G{\small OD}$ called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part. ^4

5 Then said I, O Lord $G{\small OD}$, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he _is_ small. ^5

6 The $L{\small ORD}$ repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^6

7 ¶ Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall _made_ by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. ^7

8 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more: ^8

9 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. ^9

10 ¶ Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. ^10

11 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land. ^11

12 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: ^12

13 But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it _is_ the king's chapel, and it _is_ the king's court. ^13

14 ¶ Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I _was_ no prophet, neither _was_ I a prophet's son; but I _was_ an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: ^14

15 And the $L{\small ORD}$ took me as I followed the flock, and the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. ^15

16 ¶ Now therefore hear thou the word of the $L{\small ORD}$: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not _thy_ _word_ against the house of Isaac. ^16

17 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land. ^17
