### Amos 6

1 WOE to them _that_ _are_ at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, _which_ _are_ named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came! ^1

2 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: _be_ _they_ better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border? ^2

3 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; ^3

4 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; ^4

5 That chant to the sound of the viol, _and_ invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David; ^5

6 That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. ^6

7 ¶ Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed. ^7

8 The Lord $G{\small OD}$ hath sworn by himself, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. ^8

9 And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. ^9

10 And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that _is_ by the sides of the house, _Is_ _there_ yet _any_ with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 For, behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts. ^11

12 ¶ Shall horses run upon the rock? will _one_ plow _there_ with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock: ^12

13 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? ^13

14 But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness. ^14
