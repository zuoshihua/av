### Ruth 4

1 THEN went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. ^1

2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down. ^2

3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which _was_ our brother Elimelech's: ^3

4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy _it_ before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem _it_, redeem _it:_ but if thou wilt not redeem _it_, _then_ tell me, that I may know: for _there_ _is_ none to redeem _it_ beside thee; and I _am_ after thee. And he said, I will redeem _it_. ^4

5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy _it_ also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. ^5

6 ¶ And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem _it_ for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem _it_. ^6

7 Now this _was_ _the_ _manner_ in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave _it_ to his neighbour: and this _was_ a testimony in Israel. ^7

8 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy _it_ for thee. So he drew off his shoe. ^8

9 ¶ And Boaz said unto the elders, and _unto_ all the people, Ye _are_ witnesses this day, that I have bought all that _was_ Elimelech's, and all that _was_ Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. ^9

10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye _are_ witnesses this day. ^10

11 And all the people that _were_ in the gate, and the elders, said, _We_ _are_ witnesses. The $L{\small ORD}$ make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Beth-lehem: ^11

12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the $L{\small ORD}$ shall give thee of this young woman. ^12

13 ¶ So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the $L{\small ORD}$ gave her conception, and she bare a son. ^13

14 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. ^14

15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of _thy_ life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him. ^15

16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. ^16

17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he _is_ the father of Jesse, the father of David. ^17

18 ¶ Now these _are_ the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron, ^18

19 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, ^19

20 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, ^20

21 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, ^21

22 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David. ^22
