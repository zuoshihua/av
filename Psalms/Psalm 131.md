### Psalm 131

> A Song of degrees of David.

1 LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. ^1

2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul _is_ even as a weaned child. ^2

3 Let Israel hope in the $L{\small ORD}$ from henceforth and for ever. ^3
