### Psalm 99

1 THE $L{\small ORD}$ reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth _between_ the cherubims; let the earth be moved. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ great in Zion; and he _is_ high above all the people. ^2

3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; _for_ it _is_ holy. ^3

4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. ^4

5 Exalt ye the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, and worship at his footstool; _for_ he _is_ holy. ^5

6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the $L{\small ORD}$, and he answered them. ^6

7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance _that_ he gave them. ^7

8 Thou answeredst them, O $L{\small ORD}$ our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. ^8

9 Exalt the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the $L{\small ORD}$ our God _is_ holy. ^9
