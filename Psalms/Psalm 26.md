### Psalm 26

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 JUDGE me, O $L{\small ORD}$; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the $L{\small ORD}$; _therefore_ I shall not slide. ^1

2 Examine me, O $L{\small ORD}$, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. ^2

3 For thy lovingkindness _is_ before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. ^3

4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. ^4

5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. ^5

6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O $L{\small ORD}$: ^6

7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. ^7

8 $L{\small ORD}$, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. ^8

9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: ^9

10 In whose hands _is_ mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. ^10

11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. ^11

12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12
