### Psalm 6

> To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.

1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. ^1

2 Have mercy upon me, O $L{\small ORD}$; for I _am_ weak: O $L{\small ORD}$, heal me; for my bones are vexed. ^2

3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, how long? ^3

4 Return, O $L{\small ORD}$, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake. ^4

5 For in death _there_ _is_ no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? ^5

6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. ^6

7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. ^7

8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath heard the voice of my weeping. ^8

9 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath heard my supplication; the $L{\small ORD}$ will receive my prayer. ^9

10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return _and_ be ashamed suddenly. ^10
