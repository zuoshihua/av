### Psalm 59

> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.

1 DELIVER me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. ^1

2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. ^2

3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not _for_ my transgression, nor _for_ my sin, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 They run and prepare themselves without _my_ fault: awake to help me, and behold. ^4

5 Thou therefore, O $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. ^5

6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. ^6

7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords _are_ in their lips: for who, _say_ _they_, doth hear? ^7

8 But thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. ^8

9 _Because_ _of_ his strength will I wait upon thee: for God _is_ my defence. ^9

10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see _my_ _desire_ upon mine enemies. ^10

11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. ^11

12 _For_ the sin of their mouth _and_ the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying _which_ they speak. ^12

13 Consume _them_ in wrath, consume _them_, that they _may_ not _be:_ and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. ^13

14 And at evening let them return; _and_ let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. ^14

15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied. ^15

16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. ^16

17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God _is_ my defence, _and_ the God of my mercy. ^17
