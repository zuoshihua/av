### Psalm 145

> David's _Psalm_ of praise.

1 I WILL extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. ^1

2 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. ^2

3 Great _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness _is_ unsearchable. ^3

4 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. ^4

5 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. ^5

6 And _men_ shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. ^6

7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. ^7

8 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. ^8

9 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ good to all: and his tender mercies _are_ over all his works. ^9

10 All thy works shall praise thee, O $L{\small ORD}$; and thy saints shall bless thee. ^10

11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; ^11

12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. ^12

13 Thy kingdom _is_ an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion _endureth_ throughout all generations. ^13

14 The $L{\small ORD}$ upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all _those_ _that_ _be_ bowed down. ^14

15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. ^15

16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. ^16

17 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. ^17

18 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. ^18

19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them. ^19

20 The $L{\small ORD}$ preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy. ^20

21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the $L{\small ORD}$: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever. ^21
