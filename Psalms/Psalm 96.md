### Psalm 96

1 O SING unto the $L{\small ORD}$ a new song: sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$, all the earth. ^1

2 Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. ^2

3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. ^3

4 For the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ great, and greatly to be praised: he _is_ to be feared above all gods. ^4

5 For all the gods of the nations _are_ idols: but the $L{\small ORD}$ made the heavens. ^5

6 Honour and majesty _are_ before him: strength and beauty _are_ in his sanctuary. ^6

7 Give unto the $L{\small ORD}$, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the $L{\small ORD}$ glory and strength. ^7

8 Give unto the $L{\small ORD}$ the glory _due_ _unto_ his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. ^8

9 O worship the $L{\small ORD}$ in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. ^9

10 Say among the heathen _that_ the $L{\small ORD}$ reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. ^10

11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. ^11

12 Let the field be joyful, and all that _is_ therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice ^12

13 Before the $L{\small ORD}$: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth. ^13
