### Psalm 11

> To the chief Musician, _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 IN the $L{\small ORD}$ put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee _as_ a bird to your mountain? ^1

2 For, lo, the wicked bend _their_ bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. ^2

3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? ^3

4 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ in his holy temple, the $L{\small ORD}$'s throne _is_ in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. ^4

5 The $L{\small ORD}$ trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. ^5

6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: _this_ _shall_ _be_ the portion of their cup. ^6

7 For the righteous $L{\small ORD}$ loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright. ^7
