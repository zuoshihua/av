### Psalm 146

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. Praise the $L{\small ORD}$, O my soul. ^1

2 While I live will I praise the $L{\small ORD}$: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. ^2

3 Put not your trust in princes, _nor_ in the son of man, in whom _there_ _is_ no help. ^3

4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. ^4

5 Happy _is_ _he_ that _hath_ the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope _is_ in the $L{\small ORD}$ his God: ^5

6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein _is:_ which keepeth truth for ever: ^6

7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The $L{\small ORD}$ looseth the prisoners: ^7

8 The $L{\small ORD}$ openeth _the_ _eyes_ _of_ the blind: the $L{\small ORD}$ raiseth them that are bowed down: the $L{\small ORD}$ loveth the righteous: ^8

9 The $L{\small ORD}$ preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. ^9

10 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall reign for ever, _even_ thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10
