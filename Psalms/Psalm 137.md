### Psalm 137

1 BY the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. ^1

2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. ^2

3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us _required_ _of_ _us_ mirth, _saying_, Sing us _one_ of the songs of Zion. ^3

4 How shall we sing the $L{\small ORD}$'s song in a strange land? ^4

5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget _her_ _cunning_. ^5

6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. ^6

7 Remember, O $L{\small ORD}$, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase _it_, rase _it_, _even_ to the foundation thereof. ^7

8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy _shall_ _he_ _be_, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. ^8

9 Happy _shall_ _he_ _be_, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. ^9
