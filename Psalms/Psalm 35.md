### Psalm 35

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 PLEAD _my_ _cause_, O $L{\small ORD}$, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. ^1

2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. ^2

3 Draw out also the spear, and stop _the_ _way_ against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I _am_ thy salvation. ^3

4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. ^4

5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ chase _them_. ^5

6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ persecute them. ^6

7 For without cause have they hid for me their net _in_ a pit, _which_ without cause they have digged for my soul. ^7

8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. ^8

9 And my soul shall be joyful in the $L{\small ORD}$: it shall rejoice in his salvation. ^9

10 All my bones shall say, $L{\small ORD}$, who _is_ like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? ^10

11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge _things_ that I knew not. ^11

12 They rewarded me evil for good _to_ the spoiling of my soul. ^12

13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing _was_ sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. ^13

14 I behaved myself as though _he_ _had_ _been_ my friend _or_ brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth _for_ _his_ mother. ^14

15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: _yea_, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew _it_ not; they did tear _me_, and ceased not: ^15

16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. ^16

17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. ^17

18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. ^18

19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: _neither_ let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. ^19

20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against _them_ _that_ _are_ quiet in the land. ^20

21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, _and_ said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen _it_. ^21

22 _This_ thou hast seen, O $L{\small ORD}$: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me. ^22

23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, _even_ unto my cause, my God and my Lord. ^23

24 Judge me, O $L{\small ORD}$ my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. ^24

25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. ^25

26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify _themselves_ against me. ^26

27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the $L{\small ORD}$ be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. ^27

28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness _and_ of thy praise all the day long. ^28
