### Psalm 83

> A Song _or_ Psalm of Asaph.

1 KEEP not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. ^1

2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. ^2

3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. ^3

4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from _being_ a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. ^4

5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: ^5

6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; ^6

7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; ^7

8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. ^8

9 Do unto them as _unto_ the Midianites; as _to_ Sisera, as _to_ Jabin, at the brook of Kison: ^9

10 _Which_ perished at En-dor: they became _as_ dung for the earth. ^10

11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: ^11

12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. ^12

13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. ^13

14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; ^14

15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. ^15

16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: ^17

18 That _men_ may know that thou, whose name alone _is_ JEHOVAH, _art_ the most high over all the earth. ^18
