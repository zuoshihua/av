### Psalm 138

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 I WILL praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. ^1

2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. ^2

3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, _and_ strengthenedst me _with_ strength in my soul. ^3

4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, when they hear the words of thy mouth. ^4

5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the $L{\small ORD}$: for great _is_ the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 Though the $L{\small ORD}$ _be_ high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. ^6

7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. ^7

8 The $L{\small ORD}$ will perfect _that_ _which_ concerneth me: thy mercy, O $L{\small ORD}$, _endureth_ for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands. ^8
