### Psalm 121

> A Song of degrees.

1 I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. ^1

2 My help _cometh_ from the $L{\small ORD}$, which made heaven and earth. ^2

3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. ^3

4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. ^4

5 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ thy keeper: the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ thy shade upon thy right hand. ^5

6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. ^6

7 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. ^7

8 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. ^8
