2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. ^2

3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. ^3

4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. ^4

5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. ^5

7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him. ^7
