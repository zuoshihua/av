### Psalm 32

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David, Maschil.

1 BLESSED _is_ _he_ _whose_ transgression _is_ forgiven, _whose_ sin _is_ covered. ^1

2 Blessed _is_ the man unto whom the $L{\small ORD}$ imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit _there_ _is_ no guile. ^2

3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. ^3

4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. ^4

5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the $L{\small ORD}$; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. ^5

6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. ^6

7 Thou _art_ my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. ^7

8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. ^8

9 Be ye not as the horse, _or_ as the mule, _which_ have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. ^9

10 Many sorrows _shall_ _be_ to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the $L{\small ORD}$, mercy shall compass him about. ^10

11 Be glad in the $L{\small ORD}$, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all _ye_ _that_ _are_ upright in heart. ^11
