### Psalm 75

> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, A Psalm _or_ Song of Asaph.

1 UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks, _unto_ _thee_ do we give thanks: for _that_ thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. ^1

2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. ^2

3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. ^3

4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: ^4

5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak _not_ _with_ a stiff neck. ^5

6 For promotion _cometh_ neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. ^6

7 But God _is_ the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. ^7

8 For in the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ _there_ _is_ a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring _them_ out, _and_ drink _them_. ^8

9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. ^9

10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; _but_ the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. ^10
