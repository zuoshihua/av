### Psalm 10

1 WHY standest thou afar off, O $L{\small ORD}$? _why_ hidest thou _thyself_ in times of trouble? ^1

2 The wicked in _his_ pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. ^2

3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, _whom_ the $L{\small ORD}$ abhorreth. ^3

4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek _after_ _God:_ God _is_ not in all his thoughts. ^4

5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments _are_ far above out of his sight: _as_ _for_ all his enemies, he puffeth at them. ^5

6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for _I_ _shall_ never _be_ in adversity. ^6

7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue _is_ mischief and vanity. ^7

8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. ^8

9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. ^9

10 He croucheth, _and_ humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. ^10

11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see _it_. ^11

12 Arise, O $L{\small ORD}$; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. ^12

13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require _it_. ^13

14 Thou hast seen _it;_ for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite _it_ with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. ^14

15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil _man:_ seek out his wickedness _till_ thou find none. ^15

16 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. ^16

17 $L{\small ORD}$, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: ^17

18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. ^18
