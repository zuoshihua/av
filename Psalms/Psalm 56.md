### Psalm 56

> To the chief Musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.

1 BE merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. ^1

2 Mine enemies would daily swallow _me_ up: for _they_ _be_ many that fight against me, O thou most High. ^2

3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. ^3

4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. ^4

5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts _are_ against me for evil. ^5

6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. ^6

7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in _thine_ anger cast down the people, O God. ^7

8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: _are_ _they_ not in thy book? ^8

9 When I cry _unto_ _thee_, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God _is_ for me. ^9

10 In God will I praise _his_ word: in the $L{\small ORD}$ will I praise _his_ word. ^10

11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. ^11

12 Thy vows _are_ upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. ^12

13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: _wilt_ not _thou_ _deliver_ my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? ^13
