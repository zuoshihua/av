### Psalm 64

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. ^1

2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: ^2

3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, _and_ bend _their_ _bows_ _to_ _shoot_ their arrows, _even_ bitter words: ^3

4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. ^4

5 They encourage themselves _in_ an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? ^5

6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward _thought_ of every one _of_ _them_, and the heart, _is_ deep. ^6

7 But God shall shoot at them _with_ an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. ^7

8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away. ^8

9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. ^9

10 The righteous shall be glad in the $L{\small ORD}$, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory. ^10
