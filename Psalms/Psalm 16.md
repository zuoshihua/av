### Psalm 16

> Michtam of David.

1 PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. ^1

2 _O_ _my_ _soul_, thou hast said unto the $L{\small ORD}$, Thou _art_ my Lord: my goodness _extendeth_ not to thee; ^2

3 _But_ to the saints that _are_ in the earth, and _to_ the excellent, in whom _is_ all my delight. ^3

4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied _that_ hasten _after_ another _god:_ their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. ^4

5 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. ^5

6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant _places;_ yea, I have a goodly heritage. ^6

7 I will bless the $L{\small ORD}$, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. ^7

8 I have set the $L{\small ORD}$ always before me: because _he_ _is_ at my right hand, I shall not be moved. ^8

9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. ^9

10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. ^10

11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence _is_ fulness of joy; at thy right hand _there_ _are_ pleasures for evermore. ^11
