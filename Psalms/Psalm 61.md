### Psalm 61

> To the chief Musician upon Neginah, _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 HEAR my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. ^1

2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock _that_ is higher than I. ^2

3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, _and_ a strong tower from the enemy. ^3

4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. ^4

5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given _me_ the heritage of those that fear thy name. ^5

6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: _and_ his years as many generations. ^6

7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, _which_ may preserve him. ^7

8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows. ^8
