### Psalm 94

1 O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. ^1

2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. ^2

3 $L{\small ORD}$, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? ^3

4 _How_ _long_ shall they utter _and_ speak hard things? _and_ all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? ^4

5 They break in pieces thy people, O $L{\small ORD}$, and afflict thine heritage. ^5

6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. ^6

7 Yet they say, The $L{\small ORD}$ shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard _it_. ^7

8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and _ye_ fools, when will ye be wise? ^8

9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? ^9

10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, _shall_ _not_ _he_ _know?_ ^10

11 The $L{\small ORD}$ knoweth the thoughts of man, that they _are_ vanity. ^11

12 Blessed _is_ the man whom thou chastenest, O $L{\small ORD}$, and teachest him out of thy law; ^12

13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. ^13

14 For the $L{\small ORD}$ will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. ^14

15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. ^15

16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? _or_ who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? ^16

17 Unless the $L{\small ORD}$ _had_ _been_ my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. ^17

18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O $L{\small ORD}$, held me up. ^18

19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. ^19

20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? ^20

21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. ^21

22 But the $L{\small ORD}$ is my defence; and my God _is_ the rock of my refuge. ^22

23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; _yea_, the $L{\small ORD}$ our God shall cut them off. ^23
