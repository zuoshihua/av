### Psalm 124

> A Song of degrees of David.

1 IF _it_ _had_ not _been_ the $L{\small ORD}$ who was on our side, now may Israel say; ^1

2 If _it_ _had_ not _been_ the $L{\small ORD}$ who was on our side, when men rose up against us: ^2

3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: ^3

4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: ^4

5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. ^5

6 Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$, who hath not given us _as_ a prey to their teeth. ^6

7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. ^7

8 Our help _is_ in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, who made heaven and earth. ^8
