### Psalm 89

> Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

1 I WILL sing of the mercies of the $L{\small ORD}$ for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. ^1

2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. ^2

3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, ^3

4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. ^4

5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O $L{\small ORD}$: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. ^5

6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the $L{\small ORD}$? _who_ among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the $L{\small ORD}$? ^6

7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all _them_ _that_ _are_ about him. ^7

8 O $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts, who _is_ a strong $L{\small ORD}$ like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? ^8

9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. ^9

10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. ^10

11 The heavens _are_ thine, the earth also _is_ thine: _as_ _for_ the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. ^11

12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. ^12

13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, _and_ high is thy right hand. ^13

14 Justice and judgment _are_ the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. ^14

15 Blessed _is_ the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O $L{\small ORD}$, in the light of thy countenance. ^15

16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. ^16

17 For thou _art_ the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted. ^17

18 For the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ our defence; and the Holy One of Israel _is_ our king. ^18

19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon _one_ _that_ _is_ mighty; I have exalted _one_ chosen out of the people. ^19

20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: ^20

21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him. ^21

22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. ^22

23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. ^23

24 But my faithfulness and my mercy _shall_ _be_ with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted. ^24

25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. ^25

26 He shall cry unto me, Thou _art_ my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. ^26

27 Also I will make him _my_ firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. ^27

28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. ^28

29 His seed also will I make _to_ _endure_ for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. ^29

30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; ^30

31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; ^31

32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. ^32

33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. ^33

34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. ^34

35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. ^35

36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. ^36

37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and _as_ a faithful witness in heaven. Selah. ^37

38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. ^38

39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown _by_ _casting_ _it_ to the ground. ^39

40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. ^40

41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours. ^41

42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. ^42

43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. ^43

44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. ^44

45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. ^45

46 How long, $L{\small ORD}$? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? ^46

47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? ^47

48 What man _is_ _he_ _that_ liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. ^48

49 Lord, where _are_ thy former lovingkindnesses, _which_ thou swarest unto David in thy truth? ^49

50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; _how_ I do bear in my bosom _the_ _reproach_ _of_ all the mighty people; ^50

51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O $L{\small ORD}$; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. ^51

52 Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$ for evermore. Amen, and Amen. ^52
