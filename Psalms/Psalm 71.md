### Psalm 71

1 IN thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion. ^1

2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me. ^2

3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou _art_ my rock and my fortress. ^3

4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. ^4

5 For thou _art_ my hope, O Lord $G{\small OD}$: _thou_ _art_ my trust from my youth. ^5

6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise _shall_ _be_ continually of thee. ^6

7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou _art_ my strong refuge. ^7

8 Let my mouth be filled _with_ thy praise _and_ _with_ thy honour all the day. ^8

9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. ^9

10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, ^10

11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for _there_ _is_ none to deliver _him_. ^11

12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. ^12

13 Let them be confounded _and_ consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered _with_ reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt. ^13

14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more. ^14

15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness _and_ thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers _thereof_. ^15

16 I will go in the strength of the Lord $G{\small OD}$: I will make mention of thy righteousness, _even_ of thine only. ^16

17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. ^17

18 Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto _this_ generation, _and_ thy power to every one _that_ is to come. ^18

19 Thy righteousness also, O God, _is_ very high, who hast done great things: O God, who _is_ like unto thee! ^19

20 _Thou_, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth. ^20

21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side. ^21

22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, _even_ thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. ^22

23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. ^23

24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt. ^24
