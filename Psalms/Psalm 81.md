### Psalm 81

> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, _A_ _Psalm_ of Asaph.

1 SING aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. ^1

2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. ^2

3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. ^3

4 For this _was_ a statute for Israel, _and_ a law of the God of Jacob. ^4

5 This he ordained in Joseph _for_ a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: _where_ I heard a language _that_ I understood not. ^5

6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. ^6

7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. ^7

8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; ^8

9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. ^9

10 I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. ^10

11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. ^11

12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: _and_ they walked in their own counsels. ^12

13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, _and_ Israel had walked in my ways! ^13

14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. ^14

15 The haters of the $L{\small ORD}$ should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. ^15

16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. ^16
