### Psalm 45

> To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves.

1 MY heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue _is_ the pen of a ready writer. ^1

2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. ^2

3 Gird thy sword upon _thy_ thigh, O _most_ mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. ^3

4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness _and_ righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. ^4

5 Thine arrows _are_ sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; _whereby_ the people fall under thee. ^5

6 Thy throne, O God, _is_ for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom _is_ a right sceptre. ^6

7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. ^7

8 All thy garments _smell_ of myrrh, and aloes, _and_ cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad. ^8

9 Kings' daughters _were_ among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. ^9

10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; ^10

11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he _is_ thy Lord; and worship thou him. ^11

12 And the daughter of Tyre _shall_ _be_ _there_ with a gift; _even_ the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. ^12

13 The king's daughter _is_ all glorious within: her clothing _is_ of wrought gold. ^13

14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. ^14

15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace. ^15

16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. ^16

17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever. ^17
