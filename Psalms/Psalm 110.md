### Psalm 110

> A Psalm of David.

1 THE $L{\small ORD}$ said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. ^2

3 Thy people _shall_ _be_ willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. ^3

4 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou _art_ a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. ^4

5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. ^5

6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill _the_ _places_ with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. ^6

7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. ^7
