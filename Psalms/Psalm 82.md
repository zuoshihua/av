### Psalm 82

> A Psalm of Asaph.

1 GOD standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. ^1

2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. ^2

3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. ^3

4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid _them_ out of the hand of the wicked. ^4

5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. ^5

6 I have said, Ye _are_ gods; and all of you _are_ children of the most High. ^6

7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. ^7

8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations. ^8
