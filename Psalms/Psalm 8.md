### Psalm 8

> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.

1 O LORD our Lord, how excellent _is_ thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. ^1

2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. ^2

3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; ^3

4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? ^4

5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. ^5

6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all _things_ under his feet: ^6

7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; ^7

8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, _and_ _whatsoever_ passeth through the paths of the seas. ^8

9 O $L{\small ORD}$ our Lord, how excellent _is_ thy name in all the earth! ^9
