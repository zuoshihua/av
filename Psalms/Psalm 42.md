### Psalm 42

> To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.

1 AS the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. ^1

2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? ^2

3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where _is_ thy God? ^3

4 When I remember these _things_, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday. ^4

5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and _why_ art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him _for_ the help of his countenance. ^5

6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. ^6

7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. ^7

8 _Yet_ the $L{\small ORD}$ will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song _shall_ _be_ with me, _and_ my prayer unto the God of my life. ^8

9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? ^9

10 _As_ with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where _is_ thy God? ^10

11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, _who_ _is_ the health of my countenance, and my God. ^11
