### Psalm 21

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 THE king shall joy in thy strength, O $L{\small ORD}$; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! ^1

2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah. ^2

3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. ^3

4 He asked life of thee, _and_ thou gavest _it_ him, _even_ length of days for ever and ever. ^4

5 His glory _is_ great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him. ^5

6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. ^6

7 For the king trusteth in the $L{\small ORD}$, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved. ^7

8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. ^8

9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the $L{\small ORD}$ shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. ^9

10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. ^10

11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, _which_ they are not able _to_ _perform_. ^11

12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, _when_ thou shalt make ready _thine_ _arrows_ upon thy strings against the face of them. ^12

13 Be thou exalted, $L{\small ORD}$, in thine own strength: _so_ will we sing and praise thy power. ^13
