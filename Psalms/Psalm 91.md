### Psalm 91

1 HE that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. ^1

2 I will say of the $L{\small ORD}$, _He_ _is_ my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. ^2

3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, _and_ from the noisome pestilence. ^3

4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth _shall_ _be_ _thy_ shield and buckler. ^4

5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; _nor_ for the arrow _that_ flieth by day; ^5

6 _Nor_ for the pestilence _that_ walketh in darkness; _nor_ for the destruction _that_ wasteth at noonday. ^6

7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; _but_ it shall not come nigh thee. ^7

8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. ^8

9 Because thou hast made the $L{\small ORD}$, _which_ _is_ my refuge, _even_ the most High, thy habitation; ^9

10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. ^10

11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. ^11

12 They shall bear thee up in _their_ hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. ^12

13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. ^13

14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. ^14

15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I _will_ _be_ with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. ^15

16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. ^16
