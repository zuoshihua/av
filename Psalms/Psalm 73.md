### Psalm 73

> A Psalm of Asaph.

1 TRULY God _is_ good to Israel, _even_ to such as are of a clean heart. ^1

2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. ^2

3 For I was envious at the foolish, _when_ I saw the prosperity of the wicked. ^3

4 For _there_ _are_ no bands in their death: but their strength _is_ firm. ^4

5 They _are_ not in trouble _as_ _other_ men; neither are they plagued like _other_ men. ^5

6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them _as_ a garment. ^6

7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. ^7

8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly _concerning_ oppression: they speak loftily. ^8

9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. ^9

10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full _cup_ are wrung out to them. ^10

11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? ^11

12 Behold, these _are_ the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase _in_ riches. ^12

13 Verily I have cleansed my heart _in_ vain, and washed my hands in innocency. ^13

14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. ^14

15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend _against_ the generation of thy children. ^15

16 When I thought to know this, it _was_ too painful for me; ^16

17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; _then_ understood I their end. ^17

18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. ^18

19 How are they _brought_ into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. ^19

20 As a dream when _one_ awaketh; _so_, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. ^20

21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. ^21

22 So foolish _was_ I, and ignorant: I was _as_ a beast before thee. ^22

23 Nevertheless I _am_ continually with thee: thou hast holden _me_ by my right hand. ^23

24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me _to_ glory. ^24

25 Whom have I in heaven _but_ _thee?_ and _there_ _is_ none upon earth _that_ I desire beside thee. ^25

26 My flesh and my heart faileth: _but_ God _is_ the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. ^26

27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. ^27

28 But _it_ _is_ good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord $G{\small OD}$, that I may declare all thy works. ^28
