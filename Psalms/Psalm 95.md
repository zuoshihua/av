### Psalm 95

1 O COME, let us sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. ^1

2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. ^2

3 For the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ a great God, and a great King above all gods. ^3

4 In his hand _are_ the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills _is_ his also. ^4

5 The sea _is_ his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry _land_. ^5

6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the $L{\small ORD}$ our maker. ^6

7 For he _is_ our God; and we _are_ the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, ^7

8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, _and_ as _in_ the day of temptation in the wilderness: ^8

9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. ^9

10 Forty years long was I grieved with _this_ generation, and said, It _is_ a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: ^10

11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. ^11
