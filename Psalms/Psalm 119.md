### Psalm 119

**ALEPH.**

1 BLESSED _are_ the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 Blessed _are_ they that keep his testimonies, _and_ _that_ seek him with the whole heart. ^2

3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. ^3

4 Thou hast commanded _us_ to keep thy precepts diligently. ^4

5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! ^5

6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. ^6

7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments. ^7

8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly. ^8

**BETH.**

9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed _thereto_ according to thy word. ^9

10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. ^10

11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. ^11

12 Blessed _art_ thou, O $L{\small ORD}$: teach me thy statutes. ^12

13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. ^13

14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as _much_ _as_ in all riches. ^14

15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. ^15

16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. ^16

**GIMEL.**

17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, _that_ I may live, and keep thy word. ^17

18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. ^18

19 I _am_ a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me. ^19

20 My soul breaketh for the longing _that_ _it_ _hath_ unto thy judgments at all times. ^20

21 Thou hast rebuked the proud _that_ _are_ cursed, which do err from thy commandments. ^21

22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies. ^22

23 Princes also did sit _and_ speak against me: _but_ thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. ^23

24 Thy testimonies also _are_ my delight _and_ my counsellers. ^24

**DALETH.**

25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word. ^25

26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes. ^26

27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works. ^27

28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word. ^28

29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously. ^29

30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid _before_ _me_. ^30

31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O $L{\small ORD}$, put me not to shame. ^31

32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. ^32

**HE.**

33 Teach me, O $L{\small ORD}$, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it _unto_ the end. ^33

34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with _my_ whole heart. ^34

35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight. ^35

36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. ^36

37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; _and_ quicken thou me in thy way. ^37

38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who _is_ _devoted_ to thy fear. ^38

39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments _are_ good. ^39

40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness. ^40

**VAU.**

41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O $L{\small ORD}$, _even_ thy salvation, according to thy word. ^41

42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. ^42

43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. ^43

44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. ^44

45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. ^45

46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed. ^46

47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. ^47

48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. ^48

**ZAIN.**

49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. ^49

50 This _is_ my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me. ^50

51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: _yet_ have I not declined from thy law. ^51

52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O $L{\small ORD}$; and have comforted myself. ^52

53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. ^53

54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. ^54

55 I have remembered thy name, O $L{\small ORD}$, in the night, and have kept thy law. ^55

56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts. ^56

**CHETH.**

57 _Thou_ _art_ my portion, O $L{\small ORD}$: I have said that I would keep thy words. ^57

58 I intreated thy favour with _my_ whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word. ^58

59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. ^59

60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. ^60

61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: _but_ I have not forgotten thy law. ^61

62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. ^62

63 I _am_ a companion of all _them_ that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. ^63

64 The earth, O $L{\small ORD}$, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. ^64

**TETH.**

65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O $L{\small ORD}$, according unto thy word. ^65

66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments. ^66

67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. ^67

68 Thou _art_ good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. ^68

69 The proud have forged a lie against me: _but_ I will keep thy precepts with _my_ whole heart. ^69

70 Their heart is as fat as grease; _but_ I delight in thy law. ^70

71 _It_ _is_ good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. ^71

72 The law of thy mouth _is_ better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. ^72

**JOD.**

73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. ^73

74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word. ^74

75 I know, O $L{\small ORD}$, that thy judgments _are_ right, and _that_ thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. ^75

76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. ^76

77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law _is_ my delight. ^77

78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: _but_ I will meditate in thy precepts. ^78

79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies. ^79

80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed. ^80

**CAPH.**

81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: _but_ I hope in thy word. ^81

82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? ^82

83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; _yet_ do I not forget thy statutes. ^83

84 How many _are_ the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? ^84

85 The proud have digged pits for me, which _are_ not after thy law. ^85

86 All thy commandments _are_ faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me. ^86

87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. ^87

88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth. ^88

**LAMED.**

89 For ever, O $L{\small ORD}$, thy word is settled in heaven. ^89

90 Thy faithfulness _is_ unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. ^90

91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all _are_ thy servants. ^91

92 Unless thy law _had_ _been_ my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction. ^92

93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. ^93

94 I _am_ thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts. ^94

95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: _but_ I will consider thy testimonies. ^95

96 I have seen an end of all perfection: _but_ thy commandment _is_ exceeding broad. ^96

**MEM.**

97 O how love I thy law! it _is_ my meditation all the day. ^97

98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they _are_ ever with me. ^98

99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies _are_ my meditation. ^99

100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. ^100

101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. ^101

102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me. ^102

103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! _yea_, _sweeter_ than honey to my mouth! ^103

104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. ^104

**NUN.**

105 Thy word _is_ a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. ^105

106 I have sworn, and I will perform _it_, that I will keep thy righteous judgments. ^106

107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O $L{\small ORD}$, according unto thy word. ^107

108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O $L{\small ORD}$, and teach me thy judgments. ^108

109 My soul _is_ continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law. ^109

110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts. ^110

111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they _are_ the rejoicing of my heart. ^111

112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, _even_ _unto_ the end. ^112

**SAMECH.**

113 I hate _vain_ thoughts: but thy law do I love. ^113

114 Thou _art_ my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. ^114

115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God. ^115

116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. ^116

117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. ^117

118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit _is_ falsehood. ^118

119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth _like_ dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. ^119

120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments. ^120

**AIN.**

121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors. ^121

122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me. ^122

123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness. ^123

124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. ^124

125 I _am_ thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. ^125

126 _It_ _is_ time for _thee_, $L{\small ORD}$, to work: _for_ they have made void thy law. ^126

127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. ^127

128 Therefore I esteem all _thy_ precepts _concerning_ all _things_ _to_ _be_ right; _and_ I hate every false way. ^128

**PE.**

129 Thy testimonies _are_ wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them. ^129

130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. ^130

131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments. ^131

132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. ^132

133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. ^133

134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts. ^134

135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. ^135

136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law. ^136

**TZADDI.**

137 Righteous _art_ thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, and upright _are_ thy judgments. ^137

138 Thy testimonies _that_ thou hast commanded _are_ righteous and very faithful. ^138

139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. ^139

140 Thy word _is_ very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. ^140

141 I _am_ small and despised: _yet_ do not I forget thy precepts. ^141

142 Thy righteousness _is_ an everlasting righteousness, and thy law _is_ the truth. ^142

143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: _yet_ thy commandments _are_ my delights. ^143

144 The righteousness of thy testimonies _is_ everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live. ^144

**KOPH.**

145 I cried with _my_ whole heart; hear me, O $L{\small ORD}$: I will keep thy statutes. ^145

146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. ^146

147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. ^147

148 Mine eyes prevent the _night_ watches, that I might meditate in thy word. ^148

149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O $L{\small ORD}$, quicken me according to thy judgment. ^149

150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law. ^150

151 Thou _art_ near, O $L{\small ORD}$; and all thy commandments _are_ truth. ^151

152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever. ^152

**RESH.**

153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law. ^153

154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word. ^154

155 Salvation _is_ far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes. ^155

156 Great _are_ thy tender mercies, O $L{\small ORD}$: quicken me according to thy judgments. ^156

157 Many _are_ my persecutors and mine enemies; _yet_ do I not decline from thy testimonies. ^157

158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word. ^158

159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O $L{\small ORD}$, according to thy lovingkindness. ^159

160 Thy word _is_ true _from_ the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments _endureth_ for ever. ^160

**SCHIN.**

161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. ^161

162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. ^162

163 I hate and abhor lying: _but_ thy law do I love. ^163

164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments. ^164

165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. ^165

166 $L{\small ORD}$, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments. ^166

167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. ^167

168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways _are_ before thee. ^168

169 Let my cry come near before thee, O $L{\small ORD}$: give me understanding according to thy word. ^169

170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. ^170

171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. ^171

172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments _are_ righteousness. ^172

173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. ^173

174 I have longed for thy salvation, O $L{\small ORD}$; and thy law _is_ my delight. ^174

175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me. ^175

176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments. ^176
