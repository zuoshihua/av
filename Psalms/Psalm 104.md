### Psalm 104

1 BLESS the $L{\small ORD}$, O my soul. O $L{\small ORD}$ my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. ^1

2 Who coverest _thyself_ with light as _with_ a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: ^2

3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: ^3

4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: ^4

5 _Who_ laid the foundations of the earth, _that_ it should not be removed for ever. ^5

6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as _with_ a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. ^6

7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. ^7

8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. ^8

9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. ^9

10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, _which_ run among the hills. ^10

11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. ^11

12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, _which_ sing among the branches. ^12

13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. ^13

14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; ^14

15 And wine _that_ maketh glad the heart of man, _and_ oil to make _his_ face to shine, and bread _which_ strengtheneth man's heart. ^15

16 The trees of the $L{\small ORD}$ are full _of_ _sap;_ the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; ^16

17 Where the birds make their nests: _as_ _for_ the stork, the fir trees _are_ her house. ^17

18 The high hills _are_ a refuge for the wild goats; _and_ the rocks for the conies. ^18

19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. ^19

20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep _forth_. ^20

21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. ^21

22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. ^22

23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. ^23

24 O $L{\small ORD}$, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. ^24

25 _So_ _is_ this great and wide sea, wherein _are_ things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. ^25

26 There go the ships: _there_ _is_ that leviathan, _whom_ thou hast made to play therein. ^26

27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give _them_ their meat in due season. ^27

28 _That_ thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. ^28

29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. ^29

30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. ^30

31 The glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall endure for ever: the $L{\small ORD}$ shall rejoice in his works. ^31

32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. ^32

33 I will sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$ as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. ^33

34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the $L{\small ORD}$. ^34

35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the $L{\small ORD}$, O my soul. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^35
