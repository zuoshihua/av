### Psalm 135

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. Praise ye the name of the $L{\small ORD}$; praise _him_, O ye servants of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 Ye that stand in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, in the courts of the house of our God, ^2

3 Praise the $L{\small ORD}$; for the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ good: sing praises unto his name; for _it_ _is_ pleasant. ^3

4 For the $L{\small ORD}$ hath chosen Jacob unto himself, _and_ Israel for his peculiar treasure. ^4

5 For I know that the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ great, and _that_ our Lord _is_ above all gods. ^5

6 Whatsoever the $L{\small ORD}$ pleased, _that_ did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. ^6

7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. ^7

8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. ^8

9 _Who_ sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. ^9

10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; ^10

11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: ^11

12 And gave their land _for_ an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. ^12

13 Thy name, O $L{\small ORD}$, _endureth_ for ever; _and_ thy memorial, O $L{\small ORD}$, throughout all generations. ^13

14 For the $L{\small ORD}$ will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants. ^14

15 The idols of the heathen _are_ silver and gold, the work of men's hands. ^15

16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; ^16

17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there _any_ breath in their mouths. ^17

18 They that make them are like unto them: _so_ _is_ every one that trusteth in them. ^18

19 Bless the $L{\small ORD}$, O house of Israel: bless the $L{\small ORD}$, O house of Aaron: ^19

20 Bless the $L{\small ORD}$, O house of Levi: ye that fear the $L{\small ORD}$, bless the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20

21 Blessed be the $L{\small ORD}$ out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21
