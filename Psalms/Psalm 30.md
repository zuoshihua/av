### Psalm 30

> A Psalm _and_ Song _at_ the dedication of the house of David.

1 I WILL extol thee, O $L{\small ORD}$; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. ^1

2 O $L{\small ORD}$ my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. ^2

3 O $L{\small ORD}$, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. ^3

4 Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. ^4

5 For his anger _endureth_ _but_ a moment; in his favour _is_ life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy _cometh_ in the morning. ^5

6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. ^6

7 $L{\small ORD}$, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, _and_ I was troubled. ^7

8 I cried to thee, O $L{\small ORD}$; and unto the $L{\small ORD}$ I made supplication. ^8

9 What profit _is_ _there_ in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? ^9

10 Hear, O $L{\small ORD}$, and have mercy upon me: $L{\small ORD}$, be thou my helper. ^10

11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; ^11

12 To the end that _my_ glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O $L{\small ORD}$ my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. ^12
