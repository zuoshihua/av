### Psalm 148

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$ from the heavens: praise him in the heights. ^1

2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. ^2

3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. ^3

4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that _be_ above the heavens. ^4

5 Let them praise the name of the $L{\small ORD}$: for he commanded, and they were created. ^5

6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass. ^6

7 Praise the $L{\small ORD}$ from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: ^7

8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word: ^8

9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: ^9

10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: ^10

11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: ^11

12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: ^12

13 Let them praise the name of the $L{\small ORD}$: for his name alone is excellent; his glory _is_ above the earth and heaven. ^13

14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; _even_ of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14
