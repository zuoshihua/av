### Psalm 139

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known _me_. ^1

2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. ^2

3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted _with_ all my ways. ^3

4 For _there_ _is_ not a word in my tongue, _but_, lo, O $L{\small ORD}$, thou knowest it altogether. ^4

5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. ^5

6 _Such_ knowledge _is_ too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot _attain_ unto it. ^6

7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? ^7

8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou _art_ there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou _art_ _there_. ^8

9 _If_ I take the wings of the morning, _and_ dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; ^9

10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. ^10

11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. ^11

12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light _are_ both alike _to_ _thee_. ^12

13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. ^13

14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully _and_ wonderfully made: marvellous _are_ thy works; and _that_ my soul knoweth right well. ^14

15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, _and_ curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. ^15

16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all _my_ _members_ were written, _which_ in continuance were fashioned, when _as_ _yet_ _there_ _was_ none of them. ^16

17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! ^17

18 _If_ I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. ^18

19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. ^19

20 For they speak against thee wickedly, _and_ thine enemies take _thy_ _name_ in vain. ^20

21 Do not I hate them, O $L{\small ORD}$, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? ^21

22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. ^22

23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: ^23

24 And see if _there_ _be_ _any_ wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. ^24
