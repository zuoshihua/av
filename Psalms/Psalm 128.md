### Psalm 128

> A Song of degrees.

1 BLESSED _is_ every one that feareth the $L{\small ORD}$; that walketh in his ways. ^1

2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy _shalt_ thou _be_, and _it_ _shall_ _be_ well with thee. ^2

3 Thy wife _shall_ _be_ as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. ^3

4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. ^5

6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, _and_ peace upon Israel. ^6
