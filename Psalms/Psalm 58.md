### Psalm 58

> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David.

1 DO ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? ^1

2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. ^2

3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. ^3

4 Their poison _is_ like the poison of a serpent: _they_ _are_ like the deaf adder _that_ stoppeth her ear; ^4

5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. ^5

6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 Let them melt away as waters _which_ run continually: _when_ he bendeth _his_ _bow_ _to_ _shoot_ his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. ^7

8 As a snail _which_ melteth, let _every_ _one_ _of_ _them_ pass away: _like_ the untimely birth of a woman, _that_ they may not see the sun. ^8

9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in _his_ wrath. ^9

10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. ^10

11 So that a man shall say, Verily _there_ _is_ a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. ^11
