### Psalm 22

> To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.

1 MY God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? _why_ _art_ _thou_ _so_ far from helping me, _and_ _from_ the words of my roaring? ^1

2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. ^2

3 But thou _art_ holy, _O_ _thou_ that inhabitest the praises of Israel. ^3

4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. ^4

5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. ^5

6 But I _am_ a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. ^6

7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, _saying_, ^7

8 He trusted on the $L{\small ORD}$ _that_ he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. ^8

9 But thou _art_ he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope _when_ _I_ _was_ upon my mother's breasts. ^9

10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou _art_ my God from my mother's belly. ^10

11 Be not far from me; for trouble _is_ near; for _there_ _is_ none to help. ^11

12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong _bulls_ of Bashan have beset me round. ^12

13 They gaped upon me _with_ their mouths, _as_ a ravening and a roaring lion. ^13

14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. ^14

15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. ^15

16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. ^16

17 I may tell all my bones: they look _and_ stare upon me. ^17

18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. ^18

19 But be not thou far from me, O $L{\small ORD}$: O my strength, haste thee to help me. ^19

20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. ^20

21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. ^21

22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. ^22

23 Ye that fear the $L{\small ORD}$, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. ^23

24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. ^24

25 My praise _shall_ _be_ of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. ^25

26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the $L{\small ORD}$ that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. ^26

27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the $L{\small ORD}$: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. ^27

28 For the kingdom _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s: and he _is_ the governor among the nations. ^28

29 All _they_ _that_ _be_ fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul. ^29

30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. ^30

31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done _this_. ^31
