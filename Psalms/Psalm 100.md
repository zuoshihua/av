### Psalm 100

> A Psalm of praise.

1 MAKE a joyful noise unto the $L{\small ORD}$, all ye lands. ^1

2 Serve the $L{\small ORD}$ with gladness: come before his presence with singing. ^2

3 Know ye that the $L{\small ORD}$ he _is_ God: _it_ _is_ he _that_ hath made us, and not we ourselves; _we_ _are_ his people, and the sheep of his pasture. ^3

4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, _and_ into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, _and_ bless his name. ^4

5 For the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ good; his mercy _is_ everlasting; and his truth _endureth_ to all generations. ^5
