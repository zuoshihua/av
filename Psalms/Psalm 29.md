### Psalm 29

> A Psalm of David.

1 GIVE unto the $L{\small ORD}$, O ye mighty, give unto the $L{\small ORD}$ glory and strength. ^1

2 Give unto the $L{\small ORD}$ the glory due unto his name; worship the $L{\small ORD}$ in the beauty of holiness. ^2

3 The voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ upon many waters. ^3

4 The voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ powerful; the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ full of majesty. ^4

5 The voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ breaketh the cedars; yea, the $L{\small ORD}$ breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. ^5

6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. ^6

7 The voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ divideth the flames of fire. ^7

8 The voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ shaketh the wilderness; the $L{\small ORD}$ shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. ^8

9 The voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of _his_ glory. ^9

10 The $L{\small ORD}$ sitteth upon the flood; yea, the $L{\small ORD}$ sitteth King for ever. ^10

11 The $L{\small ORD}$ will give strength unto his people; the $L{\small ORD}$ will bless his people with peace. ^11
