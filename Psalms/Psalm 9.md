### Psalm 9

> To the chief Musician upon Muth-labben, A Psalm of David.

1 I WILL praise _thee_, O $L{\small ORD}$, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. ^1

2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. ^2

3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. ^3

4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. ^4

5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. ^5

6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. ^6

7 But the $L{\small ORD}$ shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. ^7

8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. ^8

9 The $L{\small ORD}$ also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. ^9

10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, $L{\small ORD}$, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. ^10

11 Sing praises to the $L{\small ORD}$, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. ^11

12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. ^12

13 Have mercy upon me, O $L{\small ORD}$; consider my trouble _which_ _I_ _suffer_ of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: ^13

14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. ^14

15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit _that_ they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. ^15

16 The $L{\small ORD}$ is known _by_ the judgment _which_ he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. ^16

17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, _and_ all the nations that forget God. ^17

18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall _not_ perish for ever. ^18

19 Arise, O $L{\small ORD}$; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. ^19

20 Put them in fear, O $L{\small ORD}$: _that_ the nations may know themselves _to_ _be_ _but_ men. Selah. ^20
