### Psalm 79

> A Psalm of Asaph.

1 O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. ^1

2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given _to_ _be_ meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. ^2

3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and _there_ _was_ none to bury _them_. ^3

4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. ^4

5 How long, $L{\small ORD}$? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? ^5

6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. ^6

7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place. ^7

8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. ^8

9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. ^9

10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where _is_ their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight _by_ the revenging of the blood of thy servants _which_ _is_ shed. ^10

11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; ^11

12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. ^12

13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations. ^13
