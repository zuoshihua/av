### Psalm 127

> A Song of degrees for Solomon.

1 EXCEPT the $L{\small ORD}$ build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the $L{\small ORD}$ keep the city, the watchman waketh _but_ in vain. ^1

2 _It_ _is_ vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: _for_ so he giveth his beloved sleep. ^2

3 Lo, children _are_ an heritage of the $L{\small ORD}$: _and_ the fruit of the womb _is_ _his_ reward. ^3

4 As arrows _are_ in the hand of a mighty man; so _are_ children of the youth. ^4

5 Happy _is_ the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. ^5
