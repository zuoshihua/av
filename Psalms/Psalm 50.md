### Psalm 50

> A Psalm of Asaph.

1 THE mighty God, _even_ the $L{\small ORD}$, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. ^1

2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. ^2

3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. ^3

4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. ^4

5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. ^5

6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God _is_ judge himself. Selah. ^6

7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I _am_ God, _even_ thy God. ^7

8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, _to_ _have_ _been_ continually before me. ^8

9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, _nor_ he goats out of thy folds. ^9

10 For every beast of the forest _is_ mine, _and_ the cattle upon a thousand hills. ^10

11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field _are_ mine. ^11

12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world _is_ mine, and the fulness thereof. ^12

13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? ^13

14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: ^14

15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. ^15

16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or _that_ thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? ^16

17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. ^17

18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. ^18

19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. ^19

20 Thou sittest _and_ speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son. ^20

21 These _things_ hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether _such_ _an_ _one_ as thyself: _but_ I will reprove thee, and set _them_ in order before thine eyes. ^21

22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear _you_ in pieces, and _there_ _be_ none to deliver. ^22

23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth _his_ conversation _aright_ will I shew the salvation of God. ^23
