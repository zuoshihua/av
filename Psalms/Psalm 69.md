### Psalm 69

> To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 SAVE me, O God; for the waters are come in unto _my_ soul. ^1

2 I sink in deep mire, where _there_ _is_ no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. ^2

3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. ^3

4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, _being_ mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored _that_ which I took not away. ^4

5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. ^5

6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord $G{\small OD}$ of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. ^6

7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. ^7

8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. ^8

9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. ^9

10 When I wept, _and_ _chastened_ my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. ^10

11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. ^11

12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I _was_ the song of the drunkards. ^12

13 But as for me, my prayer _is_ unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, _in_ an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. ^13

14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. ^14

15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. ^15

16 Hear me, O $L{\small ORD}$; for thy lovingkindness _is_ good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. ^16

17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. ^17

18 Draw nigh unto my soul, _and_ redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies. ^18

19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries _are_ all before thee. ^19

20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked _for_ _some_ to take pity, but _there_ _was_ none; and for comforters, but I found none. ^20

21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. ^21

22 Let their table become a snare before them: and _that_ _which_ _should_ _have_ _been_ for _their_ welfare, _let_ _it_ _become_ a trap. ^22

23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake. ^23

24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. ^24

25 Let their habitation be desolate; _and_ let none dwell in their tents. ^25

26 For they persecute _him_ whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. ^26

27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. ^27

28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. ^28

29 But I _am_ poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. ^29

30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. ^30

31 _This_ also shall please the $L{\small ORD}$ better than an ox _or_ bullock that hath horns and hoofs. ^31

32 The humble shall see _this_, _and_ be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God. ^32

33 For the $L{\small ORD}$ heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. ^33

34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. ^34

35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession. ^35

36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein. ^36
