### Psalm 36

> To the chief Musician, _A_ _Psalm_ of David the servant of the $L{\small ORD}$.

1 THE transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, _that_ _there_ _is_ no fear of God before his eyes. ^1

2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. ^2

3 The words of his mouth _are_ iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, _and_ to do good. ^3

4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way _that_ _is_ not good; he abhorreth not evil. ^4

5 Thy mercy, O $L{\small ORD}$, _is_ in the heavens; _and_ thy faithfulness _reacheth_ unto the clouds. ^5

6 Thy righteousness _is_ like the great mountains; thy judgments _are_ a great deep: O $L{\small ORD}$, thou preservest man and beast. ^6

7 How excellent _is_ thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. ^7

8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. ^8

9 For with thee _is_ the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. ^9

10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. ^10

11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. ^11

12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise. ^12
