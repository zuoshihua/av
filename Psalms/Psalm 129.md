### Psalm 129

> A Song of degrees.

1 MANY a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: ^1

2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. ^2

3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. ^3

4 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. ^4

5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. ^5

6 Let them be as the grass _upon_ the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: ^6

7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. ^7

8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the $L{\small ORD}$ _be_ upon you: we bless you in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8
