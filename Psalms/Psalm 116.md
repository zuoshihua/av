### Psalm 116

1 I LOVE the $L{\small ORD}$, because he hath heard my voice _and_ my supplications. ^1

2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon _him_ as long as I live. ^2

3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. ^3

4 Then called I upon the name of the $L{\small ORD}$; O $L{\small ORD}$, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. ^4

5 Gracious _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$, and righteous; yea, our God _is_ merciful. ^5

6 The $L{\small ORD}$ preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. ^6

7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath dealt bountifully with thee. ^7

8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, _and_ my feet from falling. ^8

9 I will walk before the $L{\small ORD}$ in the land of the living. ^9

10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: ^10

11 I said in my haste, All men _are_ liars. ^11

12 What shall I render unto the $L{\small ORD}$ _for_ all his benefits toward me? ^12

13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 I will pay my vows unto the $L{\small ORD}$ now in the presence of all his people. ^14

15 Precious in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ the death of his saints. ^15

16 O $L{\small ORD}$, truly I _am_ thy servant; I _am_ thy servant, _and_ the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. ^16

17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 I will pay my vows unto the $L{\small ORD}$ now in the presence of all his people, ^18

19 In the courts of the $L{\small ORD}$'s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^19
