### Psalm 97

1 THE $L{\small ORD}$ reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad _thereof_. ^1

2 Clouds and darkness _are_ round about him: righteousness and judgment _are_ the habitation of his throne. ^2

3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. ^3

4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. ^4

5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the $L{\small ORD}$, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. ^5

6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. ^6

7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all _ye_ gods. ^7

8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 For thou, $L{\small ORD}$, _art_ high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. ^9

10 Ye that love the $L{\small ORD}$, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. ^10

11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. ^11

12 Rejoice in the $L{\small ORD}$, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. ^12
