### Psalm 102

> A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the L[ORD]{.calibre6}[.]{.calibre6}

1 HEAR my prayer, O $L{\small ORD}$, and let my cry come unto thee. ^1

2 Hide not thy face from me in the day _when_ I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day _when_ I call answer me speedily. ^2

3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. ^3

4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. ^4

5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. ^5

6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. ^6

7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. ^7

8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; _and_ they that are mad against me are sworn against me. ^8

9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, ^9

10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. ^10

11 My days _are_ like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. ^11

12 But thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. ^12

13 Thou shalt arise, _and_ have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. ^13

14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. ^14

15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. ^15

16 When the $L{\small ORD}$ shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. ^16

17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. ^17

18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the $L{\small ORD}$. ^18

19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the $L{\small ORD}$ behold the earth; ^19

20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; ^20

21 To declare the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; ^21

22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the $L{\small ORD}$. ^22

23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. ^23

24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years _are_ throughout all generations. ^24

25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens _are_ the work of thy hands. ^25

26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: ^26

27 But thou _art_ the same, and thy years shall have no end. ^27

28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee. ^28
