### Psalm 93

1 THE $L{\small ORD}$ reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the $L{\small ORD}$ is clothed with strength, _wherewith_ he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. ^1

2 Thy throne _is_ established of old: thou _art_ from everlasting. ^2

3 The floods have lifted up, O $L{\small ORD}$, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. ^3

4 The $L{\small ORD}$ on high _is_ mightier than the noise of many waters, _yea_, _than_ the mighty waves of the sea. ^4

5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O $L{\small ORD}$, for ever. ^5
