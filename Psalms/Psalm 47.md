### Psalm 47

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

1 O CLAP your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. ^1

2 For the $L{\small ORD}$ most high _is_ terrible; _he_ _is_ a great King over all the earth. ^2

3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. ^3

4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. ^4

5 God is gone up with a shout, the $L{\small ORD}$ with the sound of a trumpet. ^5

6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. ^6

7 For God _is_ the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. ^7

8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. ^8

9 The princes of the people are gathered together, _even_ the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth _belong_ unto God: he is greatly exalted. ^9
