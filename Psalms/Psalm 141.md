### Psalm 141

> A Psalm of David.

1 LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee. ^1

2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee _as_ incense; _and_ the lifting up of my hands _as_ the evening sacrifice. ^2

3 Set a watch, O $L{\small ORD}$, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. ^3

4 Incline not my heart to _any_ evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. ^4

5 Let the righteous smite me; _it_ _shall_ _be_ a kindness: and let him reprove me; _it_ _shall_ _be_ an excellent oil, _which_ shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also _shall_ _be_ in their calamities. ^5

6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. ^6

7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth _wood_ upon the earth. ^7

8 But mine eyes _are_ unto thee, O $G{\small OD}$ the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. ^8

9 Keep me from the snares _which_ they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. ^9

10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape. ^10
