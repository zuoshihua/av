### Psalm 20

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 THE $L{\small ORD}$ hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; ^1

2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; ^2

3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. ^3

4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. ^4

5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up _our_ banners: the $L{\small ORD}$ fulfil all thy petitions. ^5

6 Now know I that the $L{\small ORD}$ saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. ^6

7 Some _trust_ in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God. ^7

8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright. ^8

9 Save, $L{\small ORD}$: let the king hear us when we call. ^9
