### Psalm 90

> A Prayer of Moses the man of God.

1 LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. ^1

2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou _art_ God. ^2

3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. ^3

4 For a thousand years in thy sight _are_ _but_ as yesterday when it is past, and _as_ a watch in the night. ^4

5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are _as_ a sleep: in the morning _they_ _are_ like grass _which_ groweth up. ^5

6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. ^6

7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. ^7

8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret _sins_ in the light of thy countenance. ^8

9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale _that_ _is_ _told_. ^9

10 The days of our years _are_ threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength _they_ _be_ fourscore years, yet _is_ their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. ^10

11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, _so_ _is_ thy wrath. ^11

12 So teach _us_ to number our days, that we may apply _our_ hearts unto wisdom. ^12

13 Return, O $L{\small ORD}$, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. ^13

14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. ^14

15 Make us glad according to the days _wherein_ thou hast afflicted us, _and_ the years _wherein_ we have seen evil. ^15

16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. ^16

17 And let the beauty of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. ^17
