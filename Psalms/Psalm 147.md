### Psalm 147

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$: for _it_ _is_ good to sing praises unto our God; for _it_ _is_ pleasant; _and_ praise is comely. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. ^2

3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. ^3

4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by _their_ names. ^4

5 Great _is_ our Lord, and of great power: his understanding _is_ infinite. ^5

6 The $L{\small ORD}$ lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. ^6

7 Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$ with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: ^7

8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. ^8

9 He giveth to the beast his food, _and_ to the young ravens which cry. ^9

10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. ^10

11 The $L{\small ORD}$ taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. ^11

12 Praise the $L{\small ORD}$, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. ^12

13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. ^13

14 He maketh peace _in_ thy borders, _and_ filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. ^14

15 He sendeth forth his commandment _upon_ earth: his word runneth very swiftly. ^15

16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. ^16

17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? ^17

18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, _and_ the waters flow. ^18

19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. ^19

20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and _as_ _for_ _his_ judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20
