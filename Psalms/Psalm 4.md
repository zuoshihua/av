### Psalm 4

> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.

1 HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me _when_ _I_ _was_ in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. ^1

2 O ye sons of men, how long _will_ _ye_ _turn_ my glory into shame? _how_ _long_ will ye love vanity, _and_ seek after leasing? Selah. ^2

3 But know that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the $L{\small ORD}$ will hear when I call unto him. ^3

4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. ^4

5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 _There_ _be_ many that say, Who will shew us _any_ good? $L{\small ORD}$, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. ^6

7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time _that_ their corn and their wine increased. ^7

8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, $L{\small ORD}$, only makest me dwell in safety. ^8
