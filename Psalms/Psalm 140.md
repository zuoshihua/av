### Psalm 140

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 DELIVER me, O $L{\small ORD}$, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; ^1

2 Which imagine mischiefs in _their_ heart; continually are they gathered together _for_ war. ^2

3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison _is_ under their lips. Selah. ^3

4 Keep me, O $L{\small ORD}$, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. ^4

5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah. ^5

6 I said unto the $L{\small ORD}$, Thou _art_ my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 O $G{\small OD}$ the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. ^7

8 Grant not, O $L{\small ORD}$, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; _lest_ they exalt themselves. Selah. ^8

9 _As_ _for_ the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. ^9

10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. ^10

11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow _him_. ^11

12 I know that the $L{\small ORD}$ will maintain the cause of the afflicted, _and_ the right of the poor. ^12

13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence. ^13
