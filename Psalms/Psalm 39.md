### Psalm 39

> To the chief Musician, _even_ to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.

1 I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. ^1

2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, _even_ from good; and my sorrow was stirred. ^2

3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: _then_ spake I with my tongue, ^3

4 $L{\small ORD}$, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it _is;_ _that_ I may know how frail I _am_. ^4

5 Behold, thou hast made my days _as_ an handbreadth; and mine age _is_ as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state _is_ altogether vanity. Selah. ^5

6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up _riches_, and knoweth not who shall gather them. ^6

7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope _is_ in thee. ^7

8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish. ^8

9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst _it_. ^9

10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. ^10

11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man _is_ vanity. Selah. ^11

12 Hear my prayer, O $L{\small ORD}$, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I _am_ a stranger with thee, _and_ a sojourner, as all my fathers _were_. ^12

13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more. ^13
