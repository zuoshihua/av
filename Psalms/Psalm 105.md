### Psalm 105

1 O GIVE thanks unto the $L{\small ORD}$; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. ^1

2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. ^2

3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 Seek the $L{\small ORD}$, and his strength: seek his face evermore. ^4

5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; ^5

6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. ^6

7 He _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$ our God: his judgments _are_ in all the earth. ^7

8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word _which_ he commanded to a thousand generations. ^8

9 Which _covenant_ he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; ^9

10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, _and_ to Israel _for_ an everlasting covenant: ^10

11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: ^11

12 When they were _but_ a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. ^12

13 When they went from one nation to another, from _one_ kingdom to another people; ^13

14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; ^14

15 _Saying_, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. ^15

16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. ^16

17 He sent a man before them, _even_ Joseph, _who_ was sold for a servant: ^17

18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: ^18

19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ tried him. ^19

20 The king sent and loosed him; _even_ the ruler of the people, and let him go free. ^20

21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: ^21

22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. ^22

23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. ^23

24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. ^24

25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. ^25

26 He sent Moses his servant; _and_ Aaron whom he had chosen. ^26

27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. ^27

28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. ^28

29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. ^29

30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. ^30

31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, _and_ lice in all their coasts. ^31

32 He gave them hail for rain, _and_ flaming fire in their land. ^32

33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. ^33

34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, ^34

35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. ^35

36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. ^36

37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and _there_ _was_ not one feeble _person_ among their tribes. ^37

38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. ^38

39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. ^39

40 _The_ _people_ asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. ^40

41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places _like_ a river. ^41

42 For he remembered his holy promise, _and_ Abraham his servant. ^42

43 And he brought forth his people with joy, _and_ his chosen with gladness: ^43

44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; ^44

45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^45
