### Psalm 25

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 UNTO thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, do I lift up my soul. ^1

2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me. ^2

3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. ^3

4 Shew me thy ways, O $L{\small ORD}$; teach me thy paths. ^4

5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou _art_ the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. ^5

6 Remember, O $L{\small ORD}$, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they _have_ _been_ ever of old. ^6

7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 Good and upright _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. ^8

9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. ^9

10 All the paths of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. ^10

11 For thy name's sake, O $L{\small ORD}$, pardon mine iniquity; for it _is_ great. ^11

12 What man _is_ he that feareth the $L{\small ORD}$? him shall he teach in the way _that_ he shall choose. ^12

13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. ^13

14 The secret of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant. ^14

15 Mine eyes _are_ ever toward the $L{\small ORD}$; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. ^15

16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I _am_ desolate and afflicted. ^16

17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: _O_ bring thou me out of my distresses. ^17

18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. ^18

19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. ^19

20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. ^20

21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee. ^21

22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. ^22
