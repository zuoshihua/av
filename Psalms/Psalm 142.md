### Psalm 142

> Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.

1 I CRIED unto the $L{\small ORD}$ with my voice; with my voice unto the $L{\small ORD}$ did I make my supplication. ^1

2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. ^2

3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. ^3

4 I looked on _my_ right hand, and beheld, but _there_ _was_ no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. ^4

5 I cried unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$: I said, Thou _art_ my refuge _and_ my portion in the land of the living. ^5

6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. ^6

7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me. ^7
