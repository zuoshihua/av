### Psalm 112

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. Blessed _is_ the man _that_ feareth the $L{\small ORD}$, _that_ delighteth greatly in his commandments. ^1

2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. ^2

3 Wealth and riches _shall_ _be_ in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. ^3

4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: _he_ _is_ gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. ^4

5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. ^5

6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. ^6

7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 His heart _is_ established, he shall not be afraid, until he see _his_ _desire_ upon his enemies. ^8

9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. ^9

10 The wicked shall see _it_, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. ^10
