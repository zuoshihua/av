### Psalm 101

> A Psalm of David.

1 I WILL sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, will I sing. ^1

2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. ^2

3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; _it_ shall not cleave to me. ^3

4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked _person_. ^4

5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. ^5

6 Mine eyes _shall_ _be_ upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. ^6

7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. ^7

8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8
