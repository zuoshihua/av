### Psalm 107

1 O GIVE thanks unto the $L{\small ORD}$, for _he_ _is_ good: for his mercy _endureth_ for ever. ^1

2 Let the redeemed of the $L{\small ORD}$ say _so_, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; ^2

3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. ^3

4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. ^4

5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. ^5

6 Then they cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$ in their trouble, _and_ he delivered them out of their distresses. ^6

7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. ^7

8 Oh that _men_ would praise the $L{\small ORD}$ _for_ his goodness, and _for_ his wonderful works to the children of men! ^8

9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. ^9

10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, _being_ bound in affliction and iron; ^10

11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: ^11

12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and _there_ _was_ none to help. ^12

13 Then they cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$ in their trouble, _and_ he saved them out of their distresses. ^13

14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. ^14

15 Oh that _men_ would praise the $L{\small ORD}$ _for_ his goodness, and _for_ his wonderful works to the children of men! ^15

16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. ^16

17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. ^17

18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. ^18

19 Then they cry unto the $L{\small ORD}$ in their trouble, _and_ he saveth them out of their distresses. ^19

20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered _them_ from their destructions. ^20

21 Oh that _men_ would praise the $L{\small ORD}$ _for_ his goodness, and _for_ his wonderful works to the children of men! ^21

22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. ^22

23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; ^23

24 These see the works of the $L{\small ORD}$, and his wonders in the deep. ^24

25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. ^25

26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. ^26

27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end. ^27

28 Then they cry unto the $L{\small ORD}$ in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. ^28

29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. ^29

30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. ^30

31 Oh that _men_ would praise the $L{\small ORD}$ _for_ his goodness, and _for_ his wonderful works to the children of men! ^31

32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. ^32

33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; ^33

34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. ^34

35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. ^35

36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; ^36

37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. ^37

38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. ^38

39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. ^39

40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, _where_ _there_ _is_ no way. ^40

41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh _him_ families like a flock. ^41

42 The righteous shall see _it_, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. ^42

43 Whoso _is_ wise, and will observe these _things_, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^43
