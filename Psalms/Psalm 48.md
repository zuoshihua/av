### Psalm 48

> A Song _and_ Psalm for the sons of Korah.

1 GREAT _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, _in_ the mountain of his holiness. ^1

2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, _is_ mount Zion, _on_ the sides of the north, the city of the great King. ^2

3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge. ^3

4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. ^4

5 They saw _it_, _and_ so they marvelled; they were troubled, _and_ hasted away. ^5

6 Fear took hold upon them there, _and_ pain, as of a woman in travail. ^6

7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. ^7

8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. ^8

9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. ^9

10 According to thy name, O God, so _is_ thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. ^10

11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. ^11

12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. ^12

13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell _it_ to the generation following. ^13

14 For this God _is_ our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide _even_ unto death. ^14
