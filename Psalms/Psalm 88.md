### Psalm 88

> A Song _or_ Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.

1 O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day _and_ night before thee: ^1

2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry; ^2

3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. ^3

4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man _that_ _hath_ no strength: ^4

5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. ^5

6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. ^6

7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted _me_ with all thy waves. Selah. ^7

8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: _I_ _am_ shut up, and I cannot come forth. ^8

9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: $L{\small ORD}$, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee. ^9

10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise _and_ praise thee? Selah. ^10

11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? _or_ thy faithfulness in destruction? ^11

12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? ^12

13 But unto thee have I cried, O $L{\small ORD}$; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. ^13

14 $L{\small ORD}$, why castest thou off my soul? _why_ hidest thou thy face from me? ^14

15 I _am_ afflicted and ready to die from _my_ youth up: _while_ I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. ^15

16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off. ^16

17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. ^17

18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, _and_ mine acquaintance into darkness. ^18
