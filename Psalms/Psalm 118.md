### Psalm 118

1 O GIVE thanks unto the $L{\small ORD}$; for _he_ _is_ good: because his mercy _endureth_ for ever. ^1

2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy _endureth_ for ever. ^2

3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy _endureth_ for ever. ^3

4 Let them now that fear the $L{\small ORD}$ say, that his mercy _endureth_ for ever. ^4

5 I called upon the $L{\small ORD}$ in distress: the $L{\small ORD}$ answered me, _and_ _set_ _me_ in a large place. ^5

6 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? ^6

7 The $L{\small ORD}$ taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see _my_ _desire_ upon them that hate me. ^7

8 _It_ _is_ better to trust in the $L{\small ORD}$ than to put confidence in man. ^8

9 _It_ _is_ better to trust in the $L{\small ORD}$ than to put confidence in princes. ^9

10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ will I destroy them. ^10

11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ I will destroy them. ^11

12 They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ I will destroy them. ^12

13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the $L{\small ORD}$ helped me. ^13

14 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my strength and song, and is become my salvation. ^14

15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation _is_ in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ doeth valiantly. ^15

16 The right hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ is exalted: the right hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ doeth valiantly. ^16

17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. ^18

19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, _and_ I will praise the $L{\small ORD}$: ^19

20 This gate of the $L{\small ORD}$, into which the righteous shall enter. ^20

21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. ^21

22 The stone _which_ the builders refused is become the head _stone_ of the corner. ^22

23 This is the $L{\small ORD}$'s doing; it _is_ marvellous in our eyes. ^23

24 This _is_ the day _which_ the $L{\small ORD}$ hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. ^24

25 Save now, I beseech thee, O $L{\small ORD}$: O $L{\small ORD}$, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. ^25

26 Blessed _be_ he that cometh in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$: we have blessed you out of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^26

27 God _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, _even_ unto the horns of the altar. ^27

28 Thou _art_ my God, and I will praise thee: _thou_ _art_ my God, I will exalt thee. ^28

29 O give thanks unto the $L{\small ORD}$; for _he_ _is_ good: for his mercy _endureth_ for ever. ^29
