### Psalm 37

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 FRET not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. ^1

2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. ^2

3 Trust in the $L{\small ORD}$, and do good; _so_ shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. ^3

4 Delight thyself also in the $L{\small ORD}$; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. ^4

5 Commit thy way unto the $L{\small ORD}$; trust also in him; and he shall bring _it_ to pass. ^5

6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. ^6

7 Rest in the $L{\small ORD}$, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. ^7

8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. ^8

9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the $L{\small ORD}$, they shall inherit the earth. ^9

10 For yet a little while, and the wicked _shall_ not _be:_ yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it _shall_ not _be_. ^10

11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. ^11

12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. ^12

13 The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. ^13

14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, _and_ to slay such as be of upright conversation. ^14

15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. ^15

16 A little that a righteous man hath _is_ better than the riches of many wicked. ^16

17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the $L{\small ORD}$ upholdeth the righteous. ^17

18 The $L{\small ORD}$ knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. ^18

19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. ^19

20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the $L{\small ORD}$ _shall_ _be_ as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. ^20

21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth. ^21

22 For _such_ _as_ _be_ blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and _they_ _that_ _be_ cursed of him shall be cut off. ^22

23 The steps of a _good_ man are ordered by the $L{\small ORD}$: and he delighteth in his way. ^23

24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the $L{\small ORD}$ upholdeth _him_ _with_ his hand. ^24

25 I have been young, and _now_ am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. ^25

26 _He_ _is_ ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed _is_ blessed. ^26

27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. ^27

28 For the $L{\small ORD}$ loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. ^28

29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. ^29

30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. ^30

31 The law of his God _is_ in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. ^31

32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. ^32

33 The $L{\small ORD}$ will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. ^33

34 Wait on the $L{\small ORD}$, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see _it_. ^34

35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. ^35

36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he _was_ not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. ^36

37 Mark the perfect _man_, and behold the upright: for the end of _that_ man _is_ peace. ^37

38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off. ^38

39 But the salvation of the righteous _is_ of the $L{\small ORD}$: _he_ _is_ their strength in the time of trouble. ^39

40 And the $L{\small ORD}$ shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him. ^40
