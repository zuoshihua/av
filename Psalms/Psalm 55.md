### Psalm 55

> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 GIVE ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. ^1

2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; ^2

3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. ^3

4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. ^4

5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. ^5

6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! _for_ _then_ would I fly away, and be at rest. ^6

7 Lo, _then_ would I wander far off, _and_ remain in the wilderness. Selah. ^7

8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm _and_ tempest. ^8

9 Destroy, O Lord, _and_ divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. ^9

10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow _are_ in the midst of it. ^10

11 Wickedness _is_ in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets. ^11

12 For _it_ _was_ not an enemy _that_ reproached me; then I could have borne _it:_ neither _was_ _it_ he that hated me _that_ did magnify _himself_ against me; then I would have hid myself from him: ^12

13 But _it_ _was_ thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. ^13

14 We took sweet counsel together, _and_ walked unto the house of God in company. ^14

15 Let death seize upon them, _and_ let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness _is_ in their dwellings, _and_ among them. ^15

16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the $L{\small ORD}$ shall save me. ^16

17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. ^17

18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle _that_ _was_ against me: for there were many with me. ^18

19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. ^19

20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. ^20

21 _The_ _words_ of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war _was_ in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet _were_ they drawn swords. ^21

22 Cast thy burden upon the $L{\small ORD}$, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. ^22

23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee. ^23
