### Psalm 27

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 THE $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? ^1

2 When the wicked, _even_ mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. ^2

3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this _will_ I _be_ confident. ^3

4 One _thing_ have I desired of the $L{\small ORD}$, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the $L{\small ORD}$, and to inquire in his temple. ^4

5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. ^5

6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 Hear, O $L{\small ORD}$, _when_ I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. ^7

8 _When_ _thou_ _saidst_, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, $L{\small ORD}$, will I seek. ^8

9 Hide not thy face _far_ from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. ^9

10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the $L{\small ORD}$ will take me up. ^10

11 Teach me thy way, O $L{\small ORD}$, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies. ^11

12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. ^12

13 _I_ _had_ _fainted_, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the $L{\small ORD}$ in the land of the living. ^13

14 Wait on the $L{\small ORD}$: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14
