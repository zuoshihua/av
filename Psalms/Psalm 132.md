### Psalm 132

> A Song of degrees.

1 LORD, remember David, _and_ all his afflictions: ^1

2 How he sware unto the $L{\small ORD}$, _and_ vowed unto the mighty _God_ of Jacob; ^2

3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; ^3

4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, _or_ slumber to mine eyelids, ^4

5 Until I find out a place for the $L{\small ORD}$, an habitation for the mighty _God_ of Jacob. ^5

6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. ^6

7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. ^7

8 Arise, O $L{\small ORD}$, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. ^8

9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. ^9

10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. ^10

11 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath sworn _in_ truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. ^11

12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. ^12

13 For the $L{\small ORD}$ hath chosen Zion; he hath desired _it_ for his habitation. ^13

14 This _is_ my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. ^14

15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. ^15

16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. ^16

17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. ^17

18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish. ^18
