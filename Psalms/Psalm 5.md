### Psalm 5

> To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.

1 GIVE ear to my words, O $L{\small ORD}$, consider my meditation. ^1

2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. ^2

3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O $L{\small ORD}$; in the morning will I direct _my_ _prayer_ unto thee, and will look up. ^3

4 For thou _art_ not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. ^4

5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. ^5

6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the $L{\small ORD}$ will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. ^6

7 But as for me, I will come _into_ thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: _and_ in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. ^7

8 Lead me, O $L{\small ORD}$, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. ^8

9 For _there_ _is_ no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part _is_ very wickedness; their throat _is_ an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. ^9

10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. ^10

11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. ^11

12 For thou, $L{\small ORD}$, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as _with_ a shield. ^12
