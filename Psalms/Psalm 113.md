### Psalm 113

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. Praise, O ye servants of the $L{\small ORD}$, praise the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 Blessed be the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ from this time forth and for evermore. ^2

3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the $L{\small ORD}$'s name _is_ to be praised. ^3

4 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ high above all nations, _and_ his glory above the heavens. ^4

5 Who _is_ like unto the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, who dwelleth on high, ^5

6 Who humbleth _himself_ to behold _the_ _things_ _that_ _are_ in heaven, and in the earth! ^6

7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, _and_ lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; ^7

8 That he may set _him_ with princes, _even_ with the princes of his people. ^8

9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, _and_ _to_ _be_ a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9
