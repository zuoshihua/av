### Psalm 2

1 WHY do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? ^1

2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the $L{\small ORD}$, and against his anointed, _saying_, ^2

3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. ^3

4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. ^4

5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. ^5

6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. ^6

7 I will declare the decree: the $L{\small ORD}$ hath said unto me, Thou _art_ my Son; this day have I begotten thee. ^7

8 Ask of me, and I shall give _thee_ the heathen _for_ thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth _for_ thy possession. ^8

9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. ^9

10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. ^10

11 Serve the $L{\small ORD}$ with fear, and rejoice with trembling. ^11

12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish _from_ the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed _are_ all they that put their trust in him. ^12
