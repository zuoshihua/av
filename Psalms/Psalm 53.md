### Psalm 53

> To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 THE fool hath said in his heart, _There_ _is_ no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: _there_ _is_ none that doeth good. ^1

2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were _any_ that did understand, that did seek God. ^2

3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; _there_ _is_ none that doeth good, no, not one. ^3

4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people _as_ they eat bread: they have not called upon God. ^4

5 There were they in great fear, _where_ no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth _against_ thee: thou hast put _them_ to shame, because God hath despised them. ^5

6 Oh that the salvation of Israel _were_ _come_ out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, _and_ Israel shall be glad. ^6
