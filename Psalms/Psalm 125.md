### Psalm 125

> A Song of degrees.

1 THEY that trust in the $L{\small ORD}$ _shall_ _be_ as mount Zion, _which_ cannot be removed, _but_ abideth for ever. ^1

2 _As_ the mountains _are_ round about Jerusalem, so the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ round about his people from henceforth even for ever. ^2

3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. ^3

4 Do good, O $L{\small ORD}$, unto _those_ _that_ _be_ good, and to _them_ _that_ _are_ upright in their hearts. ^4

5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the $L{\small ORD}$ shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: _but_ peace _shall_ _be_ upon Israel. ^5
