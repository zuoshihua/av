### Psalm 130

> A Song of degrees.

1 OUT of the depths have I cried unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. ^2

3 If thou, $L{\small ORD}$, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? ^3

4 But _there_ _is_ forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. ^4

5 I wait for the $L{\small ORD}$, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. ^5

6 My soul _waiteth_ for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: _I_ _say_, _more_ _than_ they that watch for the morning. ^6

7 Let Israel hope in the $L{\small ORD}$: for with the $L{\small ORD}$ _there_ _is_ mercy, and with him _is_ plenteous redemption. ^7

8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. ^8
