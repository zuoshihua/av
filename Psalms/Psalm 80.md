### Psalm 80

> To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim-Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph.

1 GIVE ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest _between_ the cherubims, shine forth. ^1

2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come _and_ save us. ^2

3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^3

4 O $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? ^4

5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. ^5

6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. ^6

7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^7

8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. ^8

9 Thou preparedst _room_ before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. ^9

10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof _were_ _like_ the goodly cedars. ^10

11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. ^11

12 Why hast thou _then_ broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? ^12

13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. ^13

14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; ^14

15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch _that_ thou madest strong for thyself. ^15

16 _It_ _is_ burned with fire, _it_ _is_ cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. ^16

17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man _whom_ thou madest strong for thyself. ^17

18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. ^18

19 Turn us again, O $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. ^19
