### Psalm 41

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 BLESSED _is_ he that considereth the poor: the $L{\small ORD}$ will deliver him in time of trouble. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ will preserve him, and keep him alive; _and_ he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. ^3

4 I said, $L{\small ORD}$, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. ^4

5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? ^5

6 And if he come to see _me_, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; _when_ he goeth abroad, he telleth _it_. ^6

7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. ^7

8 An evil disease, _say_ _they_, cleaveth fast unto him: and _now_ that he lieth he shall rise up no more. ^8

9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up _his_ heel against me. ^9

10 But thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. ^10

11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. ^11

12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. ^12

13 Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. ^13
