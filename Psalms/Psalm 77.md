### Psalm 77

> To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.

1 I CRIED unto God with my voice, _even_ unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. ^1

2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. ^2

3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. ^3

4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. ^4

5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. ^5

6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. ^6

7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? ^7

8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth _his_ promise fail for evermore? ^8

9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. ^9

10 And I said, This _is_ my infirmity: _but_ _I_ _will_ _remember_ the years of the right hand of the most High. ^10

11 I will remember the works of the $L{\small ORD}$: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. ^11

12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. ^12

13 Thy way, O God, _is_ in the sanctuary: who _is_ _so_ great a God as _our_ God? ^13

14 Thou _art_ the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. ^14

15 Thou hast with _thine_ arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. ^15

16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. ^16

17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. ^17

18 The voice of thy thunder _was_ in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. ^18

19 Thy way _is_ in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. ^19

20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. ^20
