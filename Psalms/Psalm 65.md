### Psalm 65

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm _and_ Song of David.

1 PRAISE waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed. ^1

2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. ^2

3 Iniquities prevail against me: _as_ _for_ our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away. ^3

4 Blessed _is_ _the_ _man_ _whom_ thou choosest, and causest to approach _unto_ _thee_, _that_ he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, _even_ of thy holy temple. ^4

5 _By_ terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; _who_ _art_ the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off _upon_ the sea: ^5

6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; _being_ girded with power: ^6

7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. ^7

8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. ^8

9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, _which_ is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it. ^9

10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. ^10

11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. ^11

12 They drop _upon_ the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side. ^12

13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing. ^13
