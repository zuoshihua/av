### Psalm 76

> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm _or_ Song of Asaph.

1 IN Judah _is_ God known: his name _is_ great in Israel. ^1

2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. ^2

3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. ^3

4 Thou _art_ more glorious _and_ excellent than the mountains of prey. ^4

5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. ^5

6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. ^6

7 Thou, _even_ thou, _art_ to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? ^7

8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, ^8

9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. ^9

10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. ^10

11 Vow, and pay unto the $L{\small ORD}$ your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. ^11

12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: _he_ _is_ terrible to the kings of the earth. ^12
