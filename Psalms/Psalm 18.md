### Psalm 18

> To the chief Musician, _A_ _Psalm_ of David, the servant of the $L{\small ORD}$, who spake unto the $L{\small ORD}$ the words of this song in the day _that_ the $L{\small ORD}$ delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,

1 I WILL love thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, my strength. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, _and_ my high tower. ^2

3 I will call upon the $L{\small ORD}$, _who_ _is_ _worthy_ to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. ^3

4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. ^4

5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. ^5

6 In my distress I called upon the $L{\small ORD}$, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, _even_ into his ears. ^6

7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. ^7

8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. ^8

9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness _was_ under his feet. ^9

10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. ^10

11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him _were_ dark waters _and_ thick clouds of the skies. ^11

12 At the brightness _that_ _was_ before him his thick clouds passed, hail _stones_ and coals of fire. ^12

13 The $L{\small ORD}$ also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail _stones_ and coals of fire. ^13

14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. ^14

15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O $L{\small ORD}$, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. ^15

16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. ^16

17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me. ^17

18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the $L{\small ORD}$ was my stay. ^18

19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. ^19

20 The $L{\small ORD}$ rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. ^20

21 For I have kept the ways of the $L{\small ORD}$, and have not wickedly departed from my God. ^21

22 For all his judgments _were_ before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me. ^22

23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. ^23

24 Therefore hath the $L{\small ORD}$ recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. ^24

25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; ^25

26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. ^26

27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. ^27

28 For thou wilt light my candle: the $L{\small ORD}$ my God will enlighten my darkness. ^28

29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. ^29

30 _As_ _for_ God, his way _is_ perfect: the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ is tried: he _is_ a buckler to all those that trust in him. ^30

31 For who _is_ God save the $L{\small ORD}$? or who _is_ a rock save our God? ^31

32 _It_ _is_ God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. ^32

33 He maketh my feet like hinds' _feet_, and setteth me upon my high places. ^33

34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. ^34

35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. ^35

36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. ^36

37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. ^37

38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. ^38

39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. ^39

40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. ^40

41 They cried, but _there_ _was_ none to save _them:_ _even_ unto the $L{\small ORD}$, but he answered them not. ^41

42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. ^42

43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; _and_ thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people _whom_ I have not known shall serve me. ^43

44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. ^44

45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. ^45

46 The $L{\small ORD}$ liveth; and blessed _be_ my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. ^46

47 _It_ _is_ God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. ^47

48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. ^48

49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. ^49

50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore. ^50
