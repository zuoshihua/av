### Psalm 133

> A Song of degrees of David.

1 BEHOLD, how good and how pleasant _it_ _is_ for brethren to dwell together in unity! ^1

2 _It_ _is_ like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, _even_ Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; ^2

3 As the dew of Hermon, _and_ _as_ _the_ _dew_ that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded the blessing, _even_ life for evermore. ^3
