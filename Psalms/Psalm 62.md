### Psalm 62

> To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.

1 TRULY my soul waiteth upon God: from him _cometh_ my salvation. ^1

2 He only _is_ my rock and my salvation; _he_ _is_ my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. ^2

3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall _shall_ _ye_ _be_, _and_ _as_ a tottering fence. ^3

4 They only consult to cast _him_ down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. ^4

5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation _is_ from him. ^5

6 He only _is_ my rock and my salvation: _he_ _is_ my defence; I shall not be moved. ^6

7 In God _is_ my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, _and_ my refuge, _is_ in God. ^7

8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God _is_ a refuge for us. Selah. ^8

9 Surely men of low degree _are_ vanity, _and_ men of high degree _are_ a lie: to be laid in the balance, they _are_ altogether _lighter_ than vanity. ^9

10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart _upon_ _them_. ^10

11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power _belongeth_ unto God. ^11

12 Also unto thee, O Lord, _belongeth_ mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work. ^12
