### Psalm 33

1 REJOICE in the $L{\small ORD}$, O ye righteous: _for_ praise is comely for the upright. ^1

2 Praise the $L{\small ORD}$ with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery _and_ an instrument of ten strings. ^2

3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. ^3

4 For the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ right; and all his works _are_ _done_ in truth. ^4

5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 By the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. ^6

7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. ^7

8 Let all the earth fear the $L{\small ORD}$: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. ^8

9 For he spake, and it was _done;_ he commanded, and it stood fast. ^9

10 The $L{\small ORD}$ bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. ^10

11 The counsel of the $L{\small ORD}$ standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. ^11

12 Blessed _is_ the nation whose God _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$; _and_ the people _whom_ he hath chosen for his own inheritance. ^12

13 The $L{\small ORD}$ looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. ^13

14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. ^14

15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. ^15

16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. ^16

17 An horse _is_ a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver _any_ by his great strength. ^17

18 Behold, the eye of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; ^18

19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. ^19

20 Our soul waiteth for the $L{\small ORD}$: he _is_ our help and our shield. ^20

21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. ^21

22 Let thy mercy, O $L{\small ORD}$, be upon us, according as we hope in thee. ^22
