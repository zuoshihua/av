### Psalm 84

> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

1 HOW amiable _are_ thy tabernacles, O $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts! ^1

2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the $L{\small ORD}$: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. ^2

3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, _even_ thine altars, O $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, my King, and my God. ^3

4 Blessed _are_ they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. ^4

5 Blessed _is_ the man whose strength _is_ in thee; in whose heart _are_ the ways _of_ _them_. ^5

6 _Who_ passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. ^6

7 They go from strength to strength, _every_ _one_ _of_ _them_ in Zion appeareth before God. ^7

8 O $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. ^8

9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. ^9

10 For a day in thy courts _is_ better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. ^10

11 For the $L{\small ORD}$ God _is_ a sun and shield: the $L{\small ORD}$ will give grace and glory: no good _thing_ will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. ^11

12 O $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, blessed _is_ the man that trusteth in thee. ^12
