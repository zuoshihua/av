### Psalm 68

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm _or_ Song of David.

1 LET God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him. ^1

2 As smoke is driven away, _so_ drive _them_ away: as wax melteth before the fire, _so_ let the wicked perish at the presence of God. ^2

3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. ^3

4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. ^4

5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, _is_ God in his holy habitation. ^5

6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry _land_. ^6

7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: ^7

8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: _even_ Sinai itself _was_ _moved_ at the presence of God, the God of Israel. ^8

9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. ^9

10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. ^10

11 The Lord gave the word: great _was_ the company of those that published _it_. ^11

12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. ^12

13 Though ye have lien among the pots, _yet_ _shall_ _ye_ _be_ _as_ the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. ^13

14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was _white_ as snow in Salmon. ^14

15 The hill of God _is_ _as_ the hill of Bashan; an high hill _as_ the hill of Bashan. ^15

16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? _this_ _is_ the hill _which_ God desireth to dwell in; yea, the $L{\small ORD}$ will dwell _in_ _it_ for ever. ^16

17 The chariots of God _are_ twenty thousand, _even_ thousands of angels: the Lord _is_ among them, _as_ _in_ Sinai, in the holy _place_. ^17

18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, _for_ the rebellious also, that the $L{\small ORD}$ God might dwell _among_ _them_. ^18

19 Blessed _be_ the Lord, _who_ daily loadeth us _with_ _benefits_, _even_ the God of our salvation. Selah. ^19

20 _He_ _that_ _is_ our God _is_ the God of salvation; and unto $G{\small OD}$ the Lord _belong_ the issues from death. ^20

21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, _and_ the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses. ^21

22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring _my_ _people_ again from the depths of the sea: ^22

23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of _thine_ enemies, _and_ the tongue of thy dogs in the same. ^23

24 They have seen thy goings, O God; _even_ the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. ^24

25 The singers went before, the players on instruments _followed_ after; among _them_ _were_ the damsels playing with timbrels. ^25

26 Bless ye God in the congregations, _even_ the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. ^26

27 There _is_ little Benjamin _with_ their ruler, the princes of Judah _and_ their council, the princes of Zebulun, _and_ the princes of Naphtali. ^27

28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. ^28

29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee. ^29

30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, _till_ _every_ _one_ submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people _that_ delight in war. ^30

31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. ^31

32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: ^32

33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, _which_ _were_ of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, _and_ _that_ a mighty voice. ^33

34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency _is_ over Israel, and his strength _is_ in the clouds. ^34

35 O God, _thou_ _art_ terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel _is_ he that giveth strength and power unto _his_ people. Blessed _be_ God. ^35
