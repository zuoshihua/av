### Psalm 123

> A Song of degrees.

1 UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. ^1

2 Behold, as the eyes of servants _look_ unto the hand of their masters, _and_ as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes _wait_ upon the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, until that he have mercy upon us. ^2

3 Have mercy upon us, O $L{\small ORD}$, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. ^3

4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, _and_ with the contempt of the proud. ^4
