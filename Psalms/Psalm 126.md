### Psalm 126

> A Song of degrees.

1 WHEN the $L{\small ORD}$ turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. ^1

2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The $L{\small ORD}$ hath done great things for them. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath done great things for us; _whereof_ we are glad. ^3

4 Turn again our captivity, O $L{\small ORD}$, as the streams in the south. ^4

5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. ^5

6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves _with_ _him_. ^6
