### Psalm 19

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 THE heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. ^1

2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. ^2

3 _There_ _is_ no speech nor language, _where_ their voice is not heard. ^3

4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, ^4

5 Which _is_ as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, _and_ rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. ^5

6 His going forth _is_ from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. ^6

7 The law of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ sure, making wise the simple. ^7

8 The statutes of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ pure, enlightening the eyes. ^8

9 The fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ true _and_ righteous altogether. ^9

10 More to be desired _are_ _they_ than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. ^10

11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: _and_ in keeping of them _there_ _is_ great reward. ^11

12 Who can understand _his_ errors? cleanse thou me from secret _faults_. ^12

13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous _sins;_ let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. ^13

14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O $L{\small ORD}$, my strength, and my redeemer. ^14
