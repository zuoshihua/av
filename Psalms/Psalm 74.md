### Psalm 74

> Maschil of Asaph.

1 O GOD, why hast thou cast _us_ off for ever? _why_ doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? ^1

2 Remember thy congregation, _which_ thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, _which_ thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. ^2

3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; _even_ all _that_ the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. ^3

4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns _for_ signs. ^4

5 _A_ _man_ was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. ^5

6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. ^6

7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled _by_ _casting_ _down_ the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. ^7

8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. ^8

9 We see not our signs: _there_ _is_ no more any prophet: neither _is_ _there_ among us any that knoweth how long. ^9

10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? ^10

11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck _it_ out of thy bosom. ^11

12 For God _is_ my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. ^12

13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. ^13

14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, _and_ gavest him _to_ _be_ meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. ^14

15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. ^15

16 The day _is_ thine, the night also _is_ thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. ^16

17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. ^17

18 Remember this, _that_ the enemy hath reproached, O $L{\small ORD}$, and _that_ the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. ^18

19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude _of_ _the_ _wicked:_ forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. ^19

20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. ^20

21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. ^21

22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. ^22

23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually. ^23
