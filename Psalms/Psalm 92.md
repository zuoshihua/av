### Psalm 92

> A Psalm _or_ Song for the sabbath day.

1 _IT_ _is_ _a_ good _thing_ to give thanks unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: ^1

2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, ^2

3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. ^3

4 For thou, $L{\small ORD}$, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. ^4

5 O $L{\small ORD}$, how great are thy works! _and_ thy thoughts are very deep. ^5

6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. ^6

7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; _it_ _is_ that they shall be destroyed for ever: ^7

8 But thou, $L{\small ORD}$, _art_ _most_ high for evermore. ^8

9 For, lo, thine enemies, O $L{\small ORD}$, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. ^9

10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like _the_ _horn_ _of_ an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. ^10

11 Mine eye also shall see _my_ _desire_ on mine enemies, _and_ mine ears shall hear _my_ _desire_ of the wicked that rise up against me. ^11

12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. ^12

13 Those that be planted in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall flourish in the courts of our God. ^13

14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; ^14

15 To shew that the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ upright: _he_ _is_ my rock, and _there_ _is_ no unrighteousness in him. ^15
