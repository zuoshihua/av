### Psalm 85

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

1 LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. ^1

2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah. ^2

3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned _thyself_ from the fierceness of thine anger. ^3

4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease. ^4

5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? ^5

6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? ^6

7 Shew us thy mercy, O $L{\small ORD}$, and grant us thy salvation. ^7

8 I will hear what God the $L{\small ORD}$ will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. ^8

9 Surely his salvation _is_ nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. ^9

10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed _each_ _other_. ^10

11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. ^11

12 Yea, the $L{\small ORD}$ shall give _that_ _which_ _is_ good; and our land shall yield her increase. ^12

13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set _us_ in the way of his steps. ^13
