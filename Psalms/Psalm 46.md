### Psalm 46

> To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth.

1 GOD _is_ our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. ^1

2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; ^2

3 _Though_ the waters thereof roar _and_ be troubled, _though_ the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. ^3

4 _There_ _is_ a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy _place_ of the tabernacles of the most High. ^4

5 God _is_ in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, _and_ _that_ right early. ^5

6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. ^6

7 The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ with us; the God of Jacob _is_ our refuge. Selah. ^7

8 Come, behold the works of the $L{\small ORD}$, what desolations he hath made in the earth. ^8

9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. ^9

10 Be still, and know that I _am_ God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. ^10

11 The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ with us; the God of Jacob _is_ our refuge. Selah. ^11
