### Psalm 38

> A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. ^1

2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. ^2

3 _There_ _is_ no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither _is_ _there_ _any_ rest in my bones because of my sin. ^3

4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. ^4

5 My wounds stink _and_ are corrupt because of my foolishness. ^5

6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. ^6

7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome _disease:_ and _there_ _is_ no soundness in my flesh. ^7

8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. ^8

9 Lord, all my desire _is_ before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. ^9

10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. ^10

11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. ^11

12 They also that seek after my life lay snares _for_ _me:_ and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. ^12

13 But I, as a deaf _man_, heard not; and _I_ _was_ as a dumb man _that_ openeth not his mouth. ^13

14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth _are_ no reproofs. ^14

15 For in thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. ^15

16 For I said, _Hear_ _me_, lest _otherwise_ they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify _themselves_ against me. ^16

17 For I _am_ ready to halt, and my sorrow _is_ continually before me. ^17

18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. ^18

19 But mine enemies _are_ lively, _and_ they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. ^19

20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow _the_ _thing_ _that_ good _is_. ^20

21 Forsake me not, O $L{\small ORD}$: O my God, be not far from me. ^21

22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. ^22
