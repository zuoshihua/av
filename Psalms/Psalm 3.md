### Psalm 3

> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.

1 LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many _are_ they that rise up against me. ^1

2 Many _there_ _be_ which say of my soul, _There_ _is_ no help for him in God. Selah. ^2

3 But thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, _art_ a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. ^3

4 I cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$ with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. ^4

5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the $L{\small ORD}$ sustained me. ^5

6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set _themselves_ against me round about. ^6

7 Arise, O $L{\small ORD}$; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies _upon_ the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. ^7

8 Salvation _belongeth_ unto the $L{\small ORD}$: thy blessing _is_ upon thy people. Selah. ^8
