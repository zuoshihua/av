### Psalm 60

> To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.

1 O GOD, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. ^1

2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. ^2

3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. ^3

4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. ^4

5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save _with_ thy right hand, and hear me. ^5

6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. ^6

7 Gilead _is_ mine, and Manasseh _is_ mine; Ephraim also _is_ the strength of mine head; Judah _is_ my lawgiver; ^7

8 Moab _is_ my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me. ^8

9 Who will bring me _into_ the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? ^9

10 _Wilt_ not thou, O God, _which_ hadst cast us off? and _thou_, O God, _which_ didst not go out with our armies? ^10

11 Give us help from trouble: for vain _is_ the help of man. ^11

12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he _it_ _is_ _that_ shall tread down our enemies. ^12
