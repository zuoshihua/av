### Psalm 28

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 UNTO thee will I cry, O $L{\small ORD}$ my rock; be not silent to me: lest, _if_ thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit. ^1

2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. ^2

3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief _is_ in their hearts. ^3

4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. ^4

5 Because they regard not the works of the $L{\small ORD}$, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up. ^5

6 Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. ^6

7 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him. ^7

8 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ their strength, and he _is_ the saving strength of his anointed. ^8

9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever. ^9
