### Psalm 23

> A Psalm of David.

1 THE $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my shepherd; I shall not want. ^1

2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. ^2

3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. ^3

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou _art_ with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. ^4

5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. ^5

6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ for ever. ^6
