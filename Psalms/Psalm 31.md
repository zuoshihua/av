### Psalm 31

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 IN thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. ^1

2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. ^2

3 For thou _art_ my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me. ^3

4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou _art_ my strength. ^4

5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O $L{\small ORD}$ God of truth. ^5

6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; ^7

8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room. ^8

9 Have mercy upon me, O $L{\small ORD}$, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, _yea_, my soul and my belly. ^9

10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. ^10

11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me. ^11

12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. ^12

13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear _was_ on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. ^13

14 But I trusted in thee, O $L{\small ORD}$: I said, Thou _art_ my God. ^14

15 My times _are_ in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. ^15

16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake. ^16

17 Let me not be ashamed, O $L{\small ORD}$; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, _and_ let them be silent in the grave. ^17

18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. ^18

19 _Oh_ how great _is_ thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; _which_ thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! ^19

20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. ^20

21 Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city. ^21

22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee. ^22

23 O love the $L{\small ORD}$, all ye his saints: _for_ the $L{\small ORD}$ preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. ^23

24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the $L{\small ORD}$. ^24
