### Psalm 86

> A Prayer of David.

1 BOW down thine ear, O $L{\small ORD}$, hear me: for I _am_ poor and needy. ^1

2 Preserve my soul; for I _am_ holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. ^2

3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. ^3

4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. ^4

5 For thou, Lord, _art_ good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. ^5

6 Give ear, O $L{\small ORD}$, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. ^6

7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. ^7

8 Among the gods _there_ _is_ none like unto thee, O Lord; neither _are_ _there_ _any_ _works_ like unto thy works. ^8

9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. ^9

10 For thou _art_ great, and doest wondrous things: thou _art_ God alone. ^10

11 Teach me thy way, O $L{\small ORD}$; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. ^11

12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. ^12

13 For great _is_ thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. ^13

14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent _men_ have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. ^14

15 But thou, O Lord, _art_ a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. ^15

16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. ^16

17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see _it_, and be ashamed: because thou, $L{\small ORD}$, hast holpen me, and comforted me. ^17
