1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. ^1

2 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. ^2

3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. ^3

4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. ^4

5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. ^5

6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the $L{\small ORD}$. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6
