### Psalm 149

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$ a new song, _and_ his praise in the congregation of saints. ^1

2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. ^2

3 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. ^3

4 For the $L{\small ORD}$ taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. ^4

5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. ^5

6 _Let_ the high _praises_ of God _be_ in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; ^6

7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, _and_ punishments upon the people; ^7

8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; ^8

9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9
