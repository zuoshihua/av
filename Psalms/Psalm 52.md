### Psalm 52

> To the chief Musician, Maschil, _A_ _Psalm_ of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech.

1 WHY boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God _endureth_ continually. ^1

2 Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp rasor, working deceitfully. ^2

3 Thou lovest evil more than good; _and_ lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah. ^3

4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O _thou_ deceitful tongue. ^4

5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of _thy_ dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah. ^5

6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him: ^6

7 Lo, _this_ _is_ the man _that_ made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, _and_ strengthened himself in his wickedness. ^7

8 But I _am_ like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. ^8

9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done _it:_ and I will wait on thy name; for _it_ _is_ good before thy saints. ^9
