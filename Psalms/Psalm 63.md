### Psalm 63

> A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

1 O GOD, thou _art_ my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; ^1

2 To see thy power and thy glory, so _as_ I have seen thee in the sanctuary. ^2

3 Because thy lovingkindness _is_ better than life, my lips shall praise thee. ^3

4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. ^4

5 My soul shall be satisfied as _with_ marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise _thee_ with joyful lips: ^5

6 When I remember thee upon my bed, _and_ meditate on thee in the _night_ watches. ^6

7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. ^7

8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. ^8

9 But those _that_ seek my soul, to destroy _it_, shall go into the lower parts of the earth. ^9

10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. ^10

11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. ^11
