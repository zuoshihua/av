### Psalm 12

> To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.

1 HELP, $L{\small ORD}$; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. ^1

2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: _with_ flattering lips _and_ with a double heart do they speak. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall cut off all flattering lips, _and_ the tongue that speaketh proud things: ^3

4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips _are_ our own: who _is_ lord over us? ^4

5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; I will set _him_ in safety _from_ _him_ _that_ puffeth at him. ^5

6 The words of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ pure words: _as_ silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. ^6

7 Thou shalt keep them, O $L{\small ORD}$, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. ^7

8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. ^8
