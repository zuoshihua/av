### Psalm 108

> A Song _or_ Psalm of David.

1 O GOD, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. ^1

2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I _myself_ will awake early. ^2

3 I will praise thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. ^3

4 For thy mercy _is_ great above the heavens: and thy truth _reacheth_ unto the clouds. ^4

5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; ^5

6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save _with_ thy right hand, and answer me. ^6

7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. ^7

8 Gilead _is_ mine; Manasseh _is_ mine; Ephraim also _is_ the strength of mine head; Judah _is_ my lawgiver; ^8

9 Moab _is_ my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. ^9

10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? ^10

11 _Wilt_ not _thou_, O God, _who_ hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? ^11

12 Give us help from trouble: for vain _is_ the help of man. ^12

13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he _it_ _is_ _that_ shall tread down our enemies. ^13
