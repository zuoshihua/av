### Psalm 143

> A Psalm of David.

1 HEAR my prayer, O $L{\small ORD}$, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, _and_ in thy righteousness. ^1

2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. ^2

3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. ^3

4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. ^4

5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. ^5

6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul _thirsteth_ after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. ^6

7 Hear me speedily, O $L{\small ORD}$: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. ^7

8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. ^8

9 Deliver me, O $L{\small ORD}$, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. ^9

10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou _art_ my God: thy spirit _is_ good; lead me into the land of uprightness. ^10

11 Quicken me, O $L{\small ORD}$, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble. ^11

12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I _am_ thy servant. ^12
