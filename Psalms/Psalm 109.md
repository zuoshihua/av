### Psalm 109

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 HOLD not thy peace, O God of my praise; ^1

2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. ^2

3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. ^3

4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I _give_ _myself_ _unto_ prayer. ^4

5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. ^5

6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. ^6

7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. ^7

8 Let his days be few; _and_ let another take his office. ^8

9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. ^9

10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek _their_ _bread_ also out of their desolate places. ^10

11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. ^11

12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. ^12

13 Let his posterity be cut off; _and_ in the generation following let their name be blotted out. ^13

14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the $L{\small ORD}$; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. ^14

15 Let them be before the $L{\small ORD}$ continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. ^15

16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. ^16

17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. ^17

18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. ^18

19 Let it be unto him as the garment _which_ covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. ^19

20 _Let_ this _be_ the reward of mine adversaries from the $L{\small ORD}$, and of them that speak evil against my soul. ^20

21 But do thou for me, O $G{\small OD}$ the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy _is_ good, deliver thou me. ^21

22 For I _am_ poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. ^22

23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. ^23

24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. ^24

25 I became also a reproach unto them: _when_ they looked upon me they shaked their heads. ^25

26 Help me, O $L{\small ORD}$ my God: O save me according to thy mercy: ^26

27 That they may know that this _is_ thy hand; _that_ thou, $L{\small ORD}$, hast done it. ^27

28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. ^28

29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. ^29

30 I will greatly praise the $L{\small ORD}$ with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. ^30

31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save _him_ from those that condemn his soul. ^31
