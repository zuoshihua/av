### Psalm 115

1 NOT unto us, O $L{\small ORD}$, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, _and_ for thy truth's sake. ^1

2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where _is_ now their God? ^2

3 But our God _is_ in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. ^3

4 Their idols _are_ silver and gold, the work of men's hands. ^4

5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: ^5

6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: ^6

7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. ^7

8 They that make them are like unto them; _so_ _is_ every one that trusteth in them. ^8

9 O Israel, trust thou in the $L{\small ORD}$: he _is_ their help and their shield. ^9

10 O house of Aaron, trust in the $L{\small ORD}$: he _is_ their help and their shield. ^10

11 Ye that fear the $L{\small ORD}$, trust in the $L{\small ORD}$: he _is_ their help and their shield. ^11

12 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath been mindful of us: he will bless _us;_ he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. ^12

13 He will bless them that fear the $L{\small ORD}$, _both_ small and great. ^13

14 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall increase you more and more, you and your children. ^14

15 Ye _are_ blessed of the $L{\small ORD}$ which made heaven and earth. ^15

16 The heaven, _even_ the heavens, _are_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. ^16

17 The dead praise not the $L{\small ORD}$, neither any that go down into silence. ^17

18 But we will bless the $L{\small ORD}$ from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the $L{\small ORD}$. ^18
