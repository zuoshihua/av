### Psalm 114

1 WHEN Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; ^1

2 Judah was his sanctuary, _and_ Israel his dominion. ^2

3 The sea saw _it_, and fled: Jordan was driven back. ^3

4 The mountains skipped like rams, _and_ the little hills like lambs. ^4

5 What _ailed_ thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, _that_ thou wast driven back? ^5

6 Ye mountains, _that_ ye skipped like rams; _and_ ye little hills, like lambs? ^6

7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; ^7

8 Which turned the rock _into_ a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters. ^8
