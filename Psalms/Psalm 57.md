### Psalm 57

> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.

1 BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until _these_ calamities be overpast. ^1

2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth _all_ _things_ for me. ^2

3 He shall send from heaven, and save me _from_ the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. ^3

4 My soul _is_ among lions: _and_ I lie _even_ _among_ them that are set on fire, _even_ the sons of men, whose teeth _are_ spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. ^4

5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; _let_ thy glory _be_ above all the earth. ^5

6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen _themselves_. Selah. ^6

7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. ^7

8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I _myself_ will awake early. ^8

9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations. ^9

10 For thy mercy _is_ great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. ^10

11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: _let_ thy glory _be_ above all the earth. ^11
