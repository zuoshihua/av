### Psalm 24

> A Psalm of David.

1 THE earth _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. ^1

2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. ^2

3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the $L{\small ORD}$? or who shall stand in his holy place? ^3

4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. ^4

5 He shall receive the blessing from the $L{\small ORD}$, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. ^5

6 This _is_ the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. ^6

7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. ^7

8 Who _is_ this King of glory? The $L{\small ORD}$ strong and mighty, the $L{\small ORD}$ mighty in battle. ^8

9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift _them_ up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. ^9

10 Who is this King of glory? The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, he _is_ the King of glory. Selah. ^10
