### Psalm 40

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 I WAITED patiently for the $L{\small ORD}$; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. ^1

2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, _and_ established my goings. ^2

3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, _even_ praise unto our God: many shall see _it_, and fear, and shall trust in the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 Blessed _is_ that man that maketh the $L{\small ORD}$ his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. ^4

5 Many, O $L{\small ORD}$ my God, _are_ thy wonderful works _which_ thou hast done, and thy thoughts _which_ _are_ to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: _if_ I would declare and speak _of_ _them_, they are more than can be numbered. ^5

6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. ^6

7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book _it_ _is_ written of me, ^7

8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law _is_ within my heart. ^8

9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O $L{\small ORD}$, thou knowest. ^9

10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. ^10

11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O $L{\small ORD}$: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. ^11

12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me. ^12

13 Be pleased, O $L{\small ORD}$, to deliver me: O $L{\small ORD}$, make haste to help me. ^13

14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. ^14

15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha. ^15

16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The $L{\small ORD}$ be magnified. ^16

17 But I _am_ poor and needy; _yet_ the Lord thinketh upon me: thou _art_ my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God. ^17
