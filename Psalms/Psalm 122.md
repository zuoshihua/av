### Psalm 122

> A Song of degrees of David.

1 I WAS glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. ^2

3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: ^3

4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the $L{\small ORD}$, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. ^5

6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. ^6

7 Peace be within thy walls, _and_ prosperity within thy palaces. ^7

8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace _be_ within thee. ^8

9 Because of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God I will seek thy good. ^9
