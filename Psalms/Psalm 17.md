### Psalm 17

> A Prayer of David.

1 HEAR the right, O $L{\small ORD}$, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, _that_ _goeth_ not out of feigned lips. ^1

2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. ^2

3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited _me_ in the night; thou hast tried me, _and_ shalt find nothing; I am purposed _that_ my mouth shall not transgress. ^3

4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept _me_ _from_ the paths of the destroyer. ^4

5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, _that_ my footsteps slip not. ^5

6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, _and_ _hear_ my speech. ^6

7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust _in_ _thee_ from those that rise up _against_ _them_. ^7

8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, ^8

9 From the wicked that oppress me, _from_ my deadly enemies, _who_ compass me about. ^9

10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. ^10

11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; ^11

12 Like as a lion _that_ is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. ^12

13 Arise, O $L{\small ORD}$, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, _which_ _is_ thy sword: ^13

14 From men _which_ _are_ thy hand, O $L{\small ORD}$, from men of the world, _which_ _have_ their portion in _this_ life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid _treasure:_ they are full of children, and leave the rest of their _substance_ to their babes. ^14

15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. ^15
