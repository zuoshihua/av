### Psalm 14

> To the chief Musician, _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 THE fool hath said in his heart, _There_ _is_ no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, _there_ _is_ none that doeth good. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, _and_ seek God. ^2

3 They are all gone aside, they are _all_ together become filthy: _there_ _is_ none that doeth good, no, not one. ^3

4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people _as_ they eat bread, and call not upon the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 There were they in great fear: for God _is_ in the generation of the righteous. ^5

6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ his refuge. ^6

7 Oh that the salvation of Israel _were_ _come_ out of Zion! when the $L{\small ORD}$ bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, _and_ Israel shall be glad. ^7
