### Psalm 13

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

1 HOW long wilt thou forget me, O $L{\small ORD}$? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? ^1

2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, _having_ sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? ^2

3 Consider _and_ hear me, O $L{\small ORD}$ my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the _sleep_ _of_ death; ^3

4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; _and_ those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. ^4

5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. ^5

6 I will sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. ^6
