### Psalm 103

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 BLESS the $L{\small ORD}$, O my soul: and all that is within me, _bless_ his holy name. ^1

2 Bless the $L{\small ORD}$, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: ^2

3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; ^3

4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; ^4

5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good _things;_ _so_ _that_ thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. ^5

6 The $L{\small ORD}$ executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. ^6

7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. ^7

8 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. ^8

9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep _his_ _anger_ for ever. ^9

10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. ^10

11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, _so_ great is his mercy toward them that fear him. ^11

12 As far as the east is from the west, _so_ far hath he removed our transgressions from us. ^12

13 Like as a father pitieth _his_ children, _so_ the $L{\small ORD}$ pitieth them that fear him. ^13

14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we _are_ dust. ^14

15 _As_ _for_ man, his days _are_ as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. ^15

16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. ^16

17 But the mercy of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children; ^17

18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. ^18

19 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. ^19

20 Bless the $L{\small ORD}$, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. ^20

21 Bless ye the $L{\small ORD}$, all _ye_ his hosts; _ye_ ministers of his, that do his pleasure. ^21

22 Bless the $L{\small ORD}$, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the $L{\small ORD}$, O my soul. ^22
