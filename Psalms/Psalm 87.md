### Psalm 87

> A Psalm _or_ Song for the sons of Korah.

1 HIS foundation _is_ in the holy mountains. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. ^2

3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. ^3

4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this _man_ was born there. ^4

5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. ^5

6 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall count, when he writeth up the people, _that_ this _man_ was born there. Selah. ^6

7 As well the singers as the players on instruments _shall_ _be_ _there:_ all my springs _are_ in thee. ^7
