### Psalm 15

> A Psalm of David.

1 LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? ^1

2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. ^2

3 _He_ _that_ backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. ^3

4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the $L{\small ORD}$. _He_ _that_ sweareth to _his_ _own_ hurt, and changeth not. ^4

5 _He_ _that_ putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these _things_ shall never be moved. ^5
