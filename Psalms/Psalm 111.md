### Psalm 111

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. I will praise the $L{\small ORD}$ with _my_ whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and _in_ the congregation. ^1

2 The works of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. ^2

3 His work _is_ honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. ^3

4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ gracious and full of compassion. ^4

5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. ^5

6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. ^6

7 The works of his hands _are_ verity and judgment; all his commandments _are_ sure. ^7

8 They stand fast for ever and ever, _and_ _are_ done in truth and uprightness. ^8

9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend _is_ his name. ^9

10 The fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do _his_ _commandments:_ his praise endureth for ever. ^10
