### Psalm 106

1 PRAISE ye the $L{\small ORD}$. O give thanks unto the $L{\small ORD}$; for _he_ _is_ good: for his mercy _endureth_ for ever. ^1

2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the $L{\small ORD}$? _who_ can shew forth all his praise? ^2

3 Blessed _are_ they that keep judgment, _and_ he that doeth righteousness at all times. ^3

4 Remember me, O $L{\small ORD}$, with the favour _that_ _thou_ _bearest_ _unto_ thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; ^4

5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. ^5

6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. ^6

7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked _him_ at the sea, _even_ at the Red sea. ^7

8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. ^8

9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. ^9

10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated _them_, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. ^10

11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. ^11

12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. ^12

13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: ^13

14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. ^14

15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. ^15

16 They envied Moses also in the camp, _and_ Aaron the saint of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. ^17

18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. ^18

19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. ^19

20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. ^20

21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; ^21

22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, _and_ terrible things by the Red sea. ^22

23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy _them_. ^23

24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: ^24

25 But murmured in their tents, _and_ hearkened not unto the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^25

26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: ^26

27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. ^27

28 They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. ^28

29 Thus they provoked _him_ to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. ^29

30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and _so_ the plague was stayed. ^30

31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. ^31

32 They angered _him_ also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: ^32

33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. ^33

34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded them: ^34

35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. ^35

36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. ^36

37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, ^37

38 And shed innocent blood, _even_ the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. ^38

39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. ^39

40 Therefore was the wrath of the $L{\small ORD}$ kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. ^40

41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. ^41

42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. ^42

43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked _him_ with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. ^43

44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: ^44

45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. ^45

46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. ^46

47 Save us, O $L{\small ORD}$ our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, _and_ to triumph in thy praise. ^47

48 Blessed _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$. ^48
