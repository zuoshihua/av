### Psalm 49

> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

1 HEAR this, all _ye_ people; give ear, all _ye_ inhabitants of the world: ^1

2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together. ^2

3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart _shall_ _be_ of understanding. ^3

4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. ^4

5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, _when_ the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? ^5

6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; ^6

7 None _of_ _them_ can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: ^7

8 (For the redemption of their soul _is_ precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) ^8

9 That he should still live for ever, _and_ not see corruption. ^9

10 For he seeth _that_ wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. ^10

11 Their inward thought _is_, _that_ their houses _shall_ _continue_ for ever, _and_ their dwelling places to all generations; they call _their_ lands after their own names. ^11

12 Nevertheless man _being_ in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts _that_ perish. ^12

13 This their way _is_ their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. ^13

14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. ^14

15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. ^15

16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; ^16

17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. ^17

18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and _men_ will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. ^18

19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. ^19

20 Man _that_ _is_ in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts _that_ perish. ^20
