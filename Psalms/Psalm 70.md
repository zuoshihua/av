### Psalm 70

> To the chief Musician, _A_ _Psalm_ of David, to bring to remembrance.

1 _MAKE_ _haste_, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. ^2

3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. ^3

4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. ^4

5 But I _am_ poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou _art_ my help and my deliverer; O $L{\small ORD}$, make no tarrying. ^5
