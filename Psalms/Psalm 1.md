### Psalm 1

1 BLESSED _is_ the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. ^1

2 But his delight _is_ in the law of the $L{\small ORD}$; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. ^2

3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. ^3

4 The ungodly _are_ not so: but _are_ like the chaff which the wind driveth away. ^4

5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. ^5

6 For the $L{\small ORD}$ knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. ^6
