### Psalm 144

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David.

1 BLESSED _be_ the $L{\small ORD}$ my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, _and_ my fingers to fight: ^1

2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and _he_ in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. ^2

3 $L{\small ORD}$, what _is_ man, that thou takest knowledge of him! _or_ the son of man, that thou makest account of him! ^3

4 Man is like to vanity: his days _are_ as a shadow that passeth away. ^4

5 Bow thy heavens, O $L{\small ORD}$, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. ^5

6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. ^6

7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children; ^7

8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand _is_ a right hand of falsehood. ^8

9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery _and_ an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. ^9

10 _It_ _is_ _he_ that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword. ^10

11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand _is_ a right hand of falsehood: ^11

12 That our sons _may_ _be_ as plants grown up in their youth; _that_ our daughters _may_ _be_ as corner stones, polished _after_ the similitude of a palace: ^12

13 _That_ our garners _may_ _be_ full, affording all manner of store: _that_ our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets: ^13

14 _That_ our oxen _may_ _be_ strong to labour; _that_ _there_ _be_ no breaking in, nor going out; that _there_ _be_ no complaining in our streets. ^14

15 Happy _is_ _that_ people, that is in such a case: _yea_, happy _is_ _that_ people, whose God _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^15
