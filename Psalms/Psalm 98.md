### Psalm 98

> A Psalm.

1 O SING unto the $L{\small ORD}$ a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. ^2

3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. ^3

4 Make a joyful noise unto the $L{\small ORD}$, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. ^4

5 Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$ with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. ^5

6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the $L{\small ORD}$, the King. ^6

7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. ^7

8 Let the floods clap _their_ hands: let the hills be joyful together ^8

9 Before the $L{\small ORD}$; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity. ^9
