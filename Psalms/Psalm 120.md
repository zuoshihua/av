### Psalm 120

> A Song of degrees.

1 IN my distress I cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and he heard me. ^1

2 Deliver my soul, O $L{\small ORD}$, from lying lips, _and_ from a deceitful tongue. ^2

3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? ^3

4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. ^4

5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, _that_ I dwell in the tents of Kedar! ^5

6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. ^6

7 I _am_ _for_ peace: but when I speak, they _are_ for war. ^7
