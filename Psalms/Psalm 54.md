### Psalm 54

> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, _A_ _Psalm_ of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?

1 SAVE me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. ^1

2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. ^2

3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. ^3

4 Behold, God _is_ mine helper: the Lord _is_ with them that uphold my soul. ^4

5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. ^5

6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O $L{\small ORD}$; for _it_ _is_ good. ^6

7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen _his_ _desire_ upon mine enemies. ^7
