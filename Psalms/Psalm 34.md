### Psalm 34

> _A_ _Psalm_ of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.

1 I WILL bless the $L{\small ORD}$ at all times: his praise _shall_ continually _be_ in my mouth. ^1

2 My soul shall make her boast in the $L{\small ORD}$: the humble shall hear _thereof_, and be glad. ^2

3 O magnify the $L{\small ORD}$ with me, and let us exalt his name together. ^3

4 I sought the $L{\small ORD}$, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. ^4

5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. ^5

6 This poor man cried, and the $L{\small ORD}$ heard _him_, and saved him out of all his troubles. ^6

7 The angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. ^7

8 O taste and see that the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ good: blessed _is_ the man _that_ trusteth in him. ^8

9 O fear the $L{\small ORD}$, ye his saints: for _there_ _is_ no want to them that fear him. ^9

10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the $L{\small ORD}$ shall not want any good _thing_. ^10

11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^11

12 What man _is_ _he_ _that_ desireth life, _and_ loveth _many_ days, that he may see good? ^12

13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. ^13

14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. ^14

15 The eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ upon the righteous, and his ears _are_ _open_ unto their cry. ^15

16 The face of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. ^16

17 _The_ _righteous_ cry, and the $L{\small ORD}$ heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. ^17

18 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. ^18

19 Many _are_ the afflictions of the righteous: but the $L{\small ORD}$ delivereth him out of them all. ^19

20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. ^20

21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. ^21

22 The $L{\small ORD}$ redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate. ^22
