### Numbers 3

1 THESE also _are_ the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day _that_ the $L{\small ORD}$ spake with Moses in mount Sinai. ^1

2 And these _are_ the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. ^2

3 These _are_ the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office. ^3

4 And Nadab and Abihu died before the $L{\small ORD}$, when they offered strange fire before the $L{\small ORD}$, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father. ^4

5 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^5

6 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. ^6

7 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. ^7

8 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. ^8

9 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they _are_ wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel. ^9

10 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. ^10

11 And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^11

12 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine; ^12

13 Because all the firstborn _are_ mine; _for_ on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, ^14

15 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. ^15

16 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, as he was commanded. ^16

17 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. ^17

18 And these _are_ the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei. ^18

19 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel. ^19

20 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These _are_ the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers. ^20

21 Of Gershon _was_ the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these _are_ the families of the Gershonites. ^21

22 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, _even_ those that were numbered of them _were_ seven thousand and five hundred. ^22

23 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward. ^23

24 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites _shall_ _be_ Eliasaph the son of Lael. ^24

25 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation _shall_ _be_ the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, ^25

26 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which _is_ by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof. ^26

27 ¶ And of Kohath _was_ the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these _are_ the families of the Kohathites. ^27

28 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, _were_ eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. ^28

29 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward. ^29

30 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites _shall_ _be_ Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. ^30

31 And their charge _shall_ _be_ the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof. ^31

32 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest _shall_ _be_ chief over the chief of the Levites, _and_ _have_ the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary. ^32

33 ¶ Of Merari _was_ the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these _are_ the families of Merari. ^33

34 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, _were_ six thousand and two hundred. ^34

35 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari _was_ Zuriel the son of Abihail: _these_ shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward. ^35

36 And _under_ the custody and charge of the sons of Merari _shall_ _be_ the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto, ^36

37 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. ^37

38 ¶ But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, _even_ before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, _shall_ _be_ Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. ^38

39 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, _were_ twenty and two thousand. ^39

40 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. ^40

41 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel. ^41

42 And Moses numbered, as the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel. ^42

43 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. ^43

44 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^44

45 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^45

46 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites; ^46

47 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take _them:_ (the shekel _is_ twenty gerahs:) ^47

48 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. ^48

49 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites: ^49

50 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five _shekels_, after the shekel of the sanctuary: ^50

51 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, as the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses. ^51
