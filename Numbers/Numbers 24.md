### Numbers 24

1 AND when Balaam saw that it pleased the $L{\small ORD}$ to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. ^1

2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding _in_ _his_ _tents_ according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. ^2

3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: ^3

4 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling _into_ _a_ _trance_, but having his eyes open: ^4

5 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, _and_ thy tabernacles, O Israel! ^5

6 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath planted, _and_ as cedar trees beside the waters. ^6

7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed _shall_ _be_ in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. ^7

8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce _them_ through with his arrows. ^8

9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed _is_ he that blesseth thee, and cursed _is_ he that curseth thee. ^9

10 ¶ And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed _them_ these three times. ^10

11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the $L{\small ORD}$ hath kept thee back from honour. ^11

12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, ^12

13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$, to do _either_ good or bad of mine own mind; _but_ what the $L{\small ORD}$ saith, that will I speak? ^13

14 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come _therefore_, _and_ I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days. ^14

15 ¶ And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: ^15

16 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, _which_ saw the vision of the Almighty, falling _into_ _a_ _trance_, but having his eyes open: ^16

17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. ^17

18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. ^18

19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city. ^19

20 ¶ And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek _was_ the first of the nations; but his latter end _shall_ _be_ that he perish for ever. ^20

21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. ^21

22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. ^22

23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this! ^23

24 And ships _shall_ _come_ from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever. ^24

25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way. ^25
