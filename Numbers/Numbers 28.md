### Numbers 28

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, _and_ my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, _for_ a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season. ^2

3 And thou shalt say unto them, This _is_ the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the $L{\small ORD}$; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, _for_ a continual burnt offering. ^3

4 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even; ^4

5 And a tenth _part_ of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth _part_ of an hin of beaten oil. ^5

6 _It_ _is_ a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 And the drink offering thereof _shall_ _be_ the fourth _part_ of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy _place_ shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the $L{\small ORD}$ _for_ a drink offering. ^7

8 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer _it_, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 ¶ And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour _for_ a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: ^9

10 _This_ _is_ the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering. ^10

11 ¶ And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot; ^11

12 And three tenth deals of flour _for_ a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour _for_ a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram; ^12

13 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil _for_ a meat offering unto one lamb; _for_ a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third _part_ of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth _part_ of an hin unto a lamb: this _is_ the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year. ^14

15 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering. ^15

16 And in the fourteenth day of the first month _is_ the passover of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 And in the fifteenth day of this month _is_ the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. ^17

18 In the first day _shall_ _be_ an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work _therein:_ ^18

19 But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire _for_ a burnt offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish: ^19

20 And their meat offering _shall_ _be_ _of_ flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram; ^20

21 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs: ^21

22 And one goat _for_ a sin offering, to make an atonement for you. ^22

23 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which _is_ for a continual burnt offering. ^23

24 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering. ^24

25 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work. ^25

26 ¶ Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$, after your weeks _be_ _out_, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: ^26

27 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the $L{\small ORD}$; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year; ^27

28 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram, ^28

29 A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs; ^29

30 _And_ one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you. ^30

31 Ye shall offer _them_ beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings. ^31
