### Numbers 17

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of _their_ fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. ^2

3 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod _shall_ _be_ for the head of the house of their fathers. ^3

4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you. ^4

5 And it shall come to pass, _that_ the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you. ^5

6 ¶ And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, _even_ twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron _was_ among their rods. ^6

7 And Moses laid up the rods before the $L{\small ORD}$ in the tabernacle of witness. ^7

8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. ^8

9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the $L{\small ORD}$ unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod. ^9

10 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. ^10

11 And Moses did _so:_ as the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded him, so did he. ^11

12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish. ^12

13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall die: shall we be consumed with dying? ^13
