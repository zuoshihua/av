### Numbers 23

1 AND Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. ^1

2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on _every_ altar a bullock and a ram. ^2

3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the $L{\small ORD}$ will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place. ^3

4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon _every_ altar a bullock and a ram. ^4

5 And the $L{\small ORD}$ put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. ^5

6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab. ^6

7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, _saying_, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. ^7

8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, _whom_ the $L{\small ORD}$ hath not defied? ^8

9 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. ^9

10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth _part_ of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! ^10

11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed _them_ altogether. ^11

12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath put in my mouth? ^12

13 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. ^13

14 ¶ And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on _every_ altar. ^14

15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet _the_ _$L{\small ORD}$_ yonder. ^15

16 And the $L{\small ORD}$ met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus. ^16

17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the $L{\small ORD}$ spoken? ^17

18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: ^18

19 God _is_ not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do _it?_ or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? ^19

20 Behold, I have received _commandment_ to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it. ^20

21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the $L{\small ORD}$ his God _is_ with him, and the shout of a king _is_ among them. ^21

22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn. ^22

23 Surely _there_ _is_ no enchantment against Jacob, neither _is_ _there_ any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! ^23

24 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat _of_ the prey, and drink the blood of the slain. ^24

25 ¶ And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. ^25

26 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the $L{\small ORD}$ speaketh, that I must do? ^26

27 ¶ And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. ^27

28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon. ^28

29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. ^29

30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on _every_ altar. ^30
