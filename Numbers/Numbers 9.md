### Numbers 9

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, ^1

2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. ^2

3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. ^3

4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. ^4

5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. ^5

6 ¶ And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: ^6

7 And those men said unto him, We _are_ defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the $L{\small ORD}$ in his appointed season among the children of Israel? ^7

8 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the $L{\small ORD}$ will command concerning you. ^8

9 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^9

10 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or _be_ in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, _and_ eat it with unleavened bread and bitter _herbs_. ^11

12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. ^12

13 But the man that _is_ clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the $L{\small ORD}$ in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. ^13

14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the $L{\small ORD}$; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. ^14

15 ¶ And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, _namely_, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. ^15

16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it _by_ _day_, and the appearance of fire by night. ^16

17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. ^17

18 At the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. ^18

19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the $L{\small ORD}$, and journeyed not. ^19

20 And _so_ it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ they journeyed. ^20

21 And _so_ it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and _that_ the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether _it_ _was_ by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. ^21

22 Or _whether_ _it_ _were_ two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. ^22

23 At the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ they journeyed: they kept the charge of the $L{\small ORD}$, at the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ by the hand of Moses. ^23
