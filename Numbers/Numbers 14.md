### Numbers 14

1 AND all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. ^1

2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! ^2

3 And wherefore hath the $L{\small ORD}$ brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? ^3

4 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. ^4

5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. ^5

6 ¶ And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, _which_ _were_ of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: ^6

7 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, _is_ an exceeding good land. ^7

8 If the $L{\small ORD}$ delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. ^8

9 Only rebel not ye against the $L{\small ORD}$, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they _are_ bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ with us: fear them not. ^9

10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. ^10

11 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? ^11

12 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. ^12

13 ¶ And Moses said unto the $L{\small ORD}$, Then the Egyptians shall hear _it_, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) ^13

14 And they will tell _it_ to the inhabitants of this land: _for_ they have heard that thou $L{\small ORD}$ _art_ among this people, that thou $L{\small ORD}$ art seen face to face, and _that_ thy cloud standeth over them, and _that_ thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. ^14

15 ¶ Now _if_ thou shalt kill _all_ this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, ^15

16 Because the $L{\small ORD}$ was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. ^16

17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, ^17

18 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing _the_ _guilty_, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth _generation_. ^18

19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. ^19

20 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said, I have pardoned according to thy word: ^20

21 But _as_ truly _as_ I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21

22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; ^22

23 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: ^23

24 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. ^24

25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. ^25

26 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, ^26

27 How long _shall_ _I_ _bear_ _with_ this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. ^27

28 Say unto them, _As_ _truly_ _as_ I live, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: ^28

29 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, ^29

30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, _concerning_ which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. ^30

31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. ^31

32 But _as_ _for_ you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. ^32

33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. ^33

34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, _even_ forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, _even_ forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. ^34

35 I the $L{\small ORD}$ have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. ^35

36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, ^36

37 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^37

38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, _which_ _were_ of the men that went to search the land, lived _still_. ^38

39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. ^39

40 ¶ And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we _be_ _here_, and will go up unto the place which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath promised: for we have sinned. ^40

41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$? but it shall not prosper. ^41

42 Go not up, for the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. ^42

43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites _are_ there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the $L{\small ORD}$, therefore the $L{\small ORD}$ will not be with you. ^43

44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. ^44

45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, _even_ unto Hormah. ^45
