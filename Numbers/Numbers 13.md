### Numbers 13

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ spake unto Moses, saying, ^1

2 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them. ^2

3 And Moses by the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men _were_ heads of the children of Israel. ^3

4 And these _were_ their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. ^4

5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. ^5

6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. ^6

7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. ^7

8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. ^8

9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. ^9

10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. ^10

11 Of the tribe of Joseph, _namely_, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. ^11

12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. ^12

13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. ^13

14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. ^14

15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. ^15

16 These _are_ the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. ^16

17 ¶ And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this _way_ southward, and go up into the mountain: ^17

18 And see the land, what it _is;_ and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they _be_ strong or weak, few or many; ^18

19 And what the land _is_ that they dwell in, whether it _be_ good or bad; and what cities _they_ _be_ that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; ^19

20 And what the land _is_, whether it _be_ fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time _was_ the time of the firstripe grapes. ^20

21 ¶ So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. ^21

22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, _were_. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) ^22

23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and _they_ _brought_ of the pomegranates, and of the figs. ^23

24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. ^24

25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. ^25

26 ¶ And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. ^26

27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this _is_ the fruit of it. ^27

28 Nevertheless the people _be_ strong that dwell in the land, and the cities _are_ walled, _and_ very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. ^28

29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. ^29

30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. ^30

31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they _are_ stronger than we. ^31

32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, _is_ a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it _are_ men of a great stature. ^32

33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, _which_ _come_ of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight. ^33
