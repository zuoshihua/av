### Numbers 11

1 AND _when_ the people complained, it displeased the $L{\small ORD}$: and the $L{\small ORD}$ heard _it;_ and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the $L{\small ORD}$ burnt among them, and consumed _them_ _that_ _were_ in the uttermost parts of the camp. ^1

2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the $L{\small ORD}$, the fire was quenched. ^2

3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the $L{\small ORD}$ burnt among them. ^3

4 ¶ And the mixt multitude that _was_ among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? ^4

5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: ^5

6 But now our soul _is_ dried away: _there_ _is_ nothing at all, beside this manna, _before_ our eyes. ^6

7 And the manna _was_ as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. ^7

8 _And_ the people went about, and gathered _it_, and ground _it_ in mills, or beat _it_ in a mortar, and baked _it_ in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. ^8

9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. ^9

10 ¶ Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the $L{\small ORD}$ was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased. ^10

11 And Moses said unto the $L{\small ORD}$, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? ^11

12 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? ^12

13 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. ^13

14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because _it_ _is_ too heavy for me. ^14

15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. ^15

16 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee. ^16

17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which _is_ upon thee, and will put _it_ upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear _it_ not thyself alone. ^17

18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the $L{\small ORD}$, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for _it_ _was_ well with us in Egypt: therefore the $L{\small ORD}$ will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. ^18

19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; ^19

20 _But_ even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the $L{\small ORD}$ which _is_ among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? ^20

21 And Moses said, The people, among whom I _am_, _are_ six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. ^21

22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? ^22

23 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses, Is the $L{\small ORD}$'s hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. ^23

24 ¶ And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the $L{\small ORD}$, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle. ^24

25 And the $L{\small ORD}$ came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that _was_ upon him, and gave _it_ unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, _that_, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease. ^25

26 But there remained two _of_ _the_ men in the camp, the name of the one _was_ Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they _were_ of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. ^26

27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. ^27

28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, _one_ of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. ^28

29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the $L{\small ORD}$'s people were prophets, _and_ that the $L{\small ORD}$ would put his spirit upon them! ^29

30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. ^30

31 ¶ And there went forth a wind from the $L{\small ORD}$, and brought quails from the sea, and let _them_ fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits _high_ upon the face of the earth. ^31

32 And the people stood up all that day, and all _that_ night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread _them_ all abroad for themselves round about the camp. ^32

33 And while the flesh _was_ yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the $L{\small ORD}$ was kindled against the people, and the $L{\small ORD}$ smote the people with a very great plague. ^33

34 And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted. ^34

35 _And_ the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth. ^35
