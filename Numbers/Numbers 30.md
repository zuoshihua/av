### Numbers 30

1 AND Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This _is_ the thing which the $L{\small ORD}$ hath commanded. ^1

2 If a man vow a vow unto the $L{\small ORD}$, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. ^2

3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and bind _herself_ by a bond, _being_ in her father's house in her youth; ^3

4 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. ^4

5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the $L{\small ORD}$ shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. ^5

6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; ^6

7 And her husband heard _it_, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard _it:_ then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. ^7

8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard _it;_ then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the $L{\small ORD}$ shall forgive her. ^8

9 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. ^9

10 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; ^10

11 And her husband heard _it_, and held his peace at her, _and_ disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. ^11

12 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard _them;_ _then_ whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the $L{\small ORD}$ shall forgive her. ^12

13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. ^13

14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which _are_ upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard _them_. ^14

15 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard _them;_ then he shall bear her iniquity. ^15

16 These _are_ the statutes, which the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, _being_ _yet_ in her youth in her father's house. ^16
