### Isaiah 53

1 WHO hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the $L{\small ORD}$ revealed? ^1

2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, _there_ _is_ no beauty that we should desire him. ^2

3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were _our_ faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. ^3

4 ¶ Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. ^4

5 But he _was_ wounded for our transgressions, _he_ _was_ bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace _was_ upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. ^5

6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the $L{\small ORD}$ hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. ^6

7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. ^7

8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. ^8

9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither _was_ _any_ deceit in his mouth. ^9

10 ¶ Yet it pleased the $L{\small ORD}$ to bruise him; he hath put _him_ to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see _his_ seed, he shall prolong _his_ days, and the pleasure of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall prosper in his hand. ^10

11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, _and_ shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. ^11

12 Therefore will I divide him _a_ _portion_ with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. ^12
