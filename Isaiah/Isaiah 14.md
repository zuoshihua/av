### Isaiah 14

1 FOR the $L{\small ORD}$ will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. ^1

2 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the $L{\small ORD}$ for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. ^2

3 And it shall come to pass in the day that the $L{\small ORD}$ shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve, ^3

4 ¶ That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! ^4

5 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath broken the staff of the wicked, _and_ the sceptre of the rulers. ^5

6 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, _and_ none hindereth. ^6

7 The whole earth is at rest, _and_ is quiet: they break forth into singing. ^7

8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, _and_ the cedars of Lebanon, _saying_, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us. ^8

9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet _thee_ at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, _even_ all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. ^9

10 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us? ^10

11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, _and_ the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. ^11

12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! _how_ art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! ^12

13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: ^13

14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. ^14

15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. ^15

16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, _and_ consider thee, _saying_, _Is_ this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; ^16

17 _That_ made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; _that_ opened not the house of his prisoners? ^17

18 All the kings of the nations, _even_ all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. ^18

19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, _and_ _as_ the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet. ^19

20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, _and_ slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned. ^20

21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. ^21

22 For I will rise up against them, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^22

23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^23

24 ¶ The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, _so_ shall it stand: ^24

25 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders. ^25

26 This _is_ the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this _is_ the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. ^26

27 For the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul _it?_ and his hand _is_ stretched out, and who shall turn it back? ^27

28 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. ^28

29 ¶ Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit _shall_ _be_ a fiery flying serpent. ^29

30 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant. ^30

31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, _art_ dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none _shall_ _be_ alone in his appointed times. ^31

32 What shall _one_ then answer the messengers of the nation? That the $L{\small ORD}$ hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it. ^32
