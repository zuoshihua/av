### Isaiah 50

1 THUS saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Where _is_ the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors _is_ _it_ to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away. ^1

2 Wherefore, when I came, _was_ _there_ no man? when I called, _was_ _there_ none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because _there_ _is_ no water, and dieth for thirst. ^2

3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering. ^3

4 The Lord $G{\small OD}$ hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to _him_ _that_ _is_ weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned. ^4

5 ¶ The Lord $G{\small OD}$ hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. ^5

6 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting. ^6

7 ¶ For the Lord $G{\small OD}$ will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. ^7

8 _He_ _is_ near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who _is_ mine adversary? let him come near to me. ^8

9 Behold, the Lord $G{\small OD}$ will help me; who _is_ he _that_ shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up. ^9

10 ¶ Who _is_ among you that feareth the $L{\small ORD}$, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh _in_ darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, and stay upon his God. ^10

11 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass _yourselves_ about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks _that_ ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow. ^11
