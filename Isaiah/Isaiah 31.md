### Isaiah 31

1 WOE to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because _they_ _are_ many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the $L{\small ORD}$! ^1

2 Yet he also _is_ wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. ^2

3 Now the Egyptians _are_ men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the $L{\small ORD}$ shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together. ^3

4 For thus hath the $L{\small ORD}$ spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, _he_ will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof. ^4

5 As birds flying, so will the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver _it;_ _and_ passing over he will preserve _it_. ^5

6 ¶ Turn ye unto _him_ _from_ whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. ^6

7 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you _for_ a sin. ^7

8 ¶ Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited. ^8

9 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, whose fire _is_ in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. ^9
