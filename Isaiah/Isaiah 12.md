### Isaiah 12

1 AND in that day thou shalt say, O $L{\small ORD}$, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. ^1

2 Behold, God _is_ my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the $L{\small ORD}$ JEHOVAH _is_ my strength and _my_ song; he also is become my salvation. ^2

3 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. ^3

4 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the $L{\small ORD}$, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. ^4

5 Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$; for he hath done excellent things: this _is_ known in all the earth. ^5

6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great _is_ the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. ^6
