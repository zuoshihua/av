### Isaiah 33

1 WOE to thee that spoilest, and thou _wast_ not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; _and_ when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. ^1

2 O $L{\small ORD}$, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. ^2

3 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered. ^3

4 And your spoil shall be gathered _like_ the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them. ^4

5 The $L{\small ORD}$ is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness. ^5

6 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, _and_ strength of salvation: the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ his treasure. ^6

7 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. ^7

8 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. ^8

9 The earth mourneth _and_ languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed _and_ hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off _their_ _fruits_. ^9

10 Now will I rise, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself. ^10

11 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, _as_ fire, shall devour you. ^11

12 And the people shall be _as_ the burnings of lime: _as_ thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire. ^12

13 Â¶ Hear, ye _that_ _are_ far off, what I have done; and, ye _that_ _are_ near, acknowledge my might. ^13

14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? ^14

15 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; ^15

16 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence _shall_ _be_ the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters _shall_ _be_ sure. ^16

17 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. ^17

18 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where _is_ the scribe? where _is_ the receiver? where _is_ he that counted the towers? ^18

19 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, _that_ _thou_ _canst_ not understand. ^19

20 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle _that_ shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. ^20

21 But there the glorious $L{\small ORD}$ _will_ _be_ unto us a place of broad rivers _and_ streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. ^21

22 For the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ our judge, the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ our lawgiver, the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ our king; he will save us. ^22

23 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. ^23

24 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein _shall_ _be_ forgiven _their_ iniquity. ^24
