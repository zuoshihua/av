### Isaiah 21

1 THE burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; _so_ it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land. ^1

2 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. ^2

3 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing _of_ _it;_ I was dismayed at the seeing _of_ _it_. ^3

4 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me. ^4

5 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, _and_ anoint the shield. ^5

6 For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth. ^6

7 And he saw a chariot _with_ a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, _and_ a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed: ^7

8 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: ^8

9 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, _with_ a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground. ^9

10 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you. ^10

11 ¶ The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? ^11

12 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come. ^12

13 ¶ The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim. ^13

14 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled. ^14

15 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. ^15

16 For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: ^16

17 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel hath spoken _it_. ^17
