### Isaiah 23

1 THE burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them. ^1

2 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished. ^2

3 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, _is_ her revenue; and she is a mart of nations. ^3

4 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, _even_ the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, _nor_ bring up virgins. ^4

5 As at the report concerning Egypt, _so_ shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre. ^5

6 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. ^6

7 _Is_ this your joyous _city_, whose antiquity _is_ of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn. ^7

8 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning _city_, whose merchants _are_ princes, whose traffickers _are_ the honourable of the earth? ^8

9 The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, _and_ to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth. ^9

10 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: _there_ _is_ no more strength. ^10

11 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the $L{\small ORD}$ hath given a commandment against the merchant _city_, to destroy the strong holds thereof. ^11

12 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest. ^12

13 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, _till_ the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; _and_ he brought it to ruin. ^13

14 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste. ^14

15 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot. ^15

16 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered. ^16

17 ¶ And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the $L{\small ORD}$ will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. ^17

18 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the $L{\small ORD}$: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the $L{\small ORD}$, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing. ^18
