### Isaiah 40

1 COMFORT ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. ^1

2 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the $L{\small ORD}$'s hand double for all her sins. ^2

3 ¶ The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the $L{\small ORD}$, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. ^3

4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: ^4

5 And the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see _it_ together: for the mouth of the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken _it_. ^5

6 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh _is_ grass, and all the goodliness thereof _is_ as the flower of the field: ^6

7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ bloweth upon it: surely the people _is_ grass. ^7

8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever. ^8

9 ¶ O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift _it_ up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! ^9

10 Behold, the Lord $G{\small OD}$ will come with strong _hand_, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward _is_ with him, and his work before him. ^10

11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry _them_ in his bosom, _and_ shall gently lead those that are with young. ^11

12 ¶ Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? ^12

13 Who hath directed the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$, or _being_ his counseller hath taught him? ^13

14 With whom took he counsel, and _who_ instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding? ^14

15 Behold, the nations _are_ as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. ^15

16 And Lebanon _is_ not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. ^16

17 All nations before him _are_ as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. ^17

18 ¶ To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? ^18

19 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains. ^19

20 He that _is_ so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree _that_ will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, _that_ shall not be moved. ^20

21 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? ^21

22 _It_ _is_ he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof _are_ as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: ^22

23 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. ^23

24 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble. ^24

25 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. ^25

26 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these _things_, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that _he_ _is_ strong in power; not one faileth. ^26

27 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the $L{\small ORD}$, and my judgment is passed over from my God? ^27

28 ¶ Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, _that_ the everlasting God, the $L{\small ORD}$, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? _there_ _is_ no searching of his understanding. ^28

29 He giveth power to the faint; and to _them_ _that_ _have_ no might he increaseth strength. ^29

30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: ^30

31 But they that wait upon the $L{\small ORD}$ shall renew _their_ strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; _and_ they shall walk, and not faint. ^31
