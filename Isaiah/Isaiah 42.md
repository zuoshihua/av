### Isaiah 42

1 BEHOLD my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, _in_ _whom_ my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. ^1

2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. ^2

3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. ^3

4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law. ^4

5 ¶ Thus saith God the $L{\small ORD}$, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: ^5

6 I the $L{\small ORD}$ have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; ^6

7 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, _and_ them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. ^7

8 I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$: that _is_ my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. ^8

9 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them. ^9

10 Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$ a new song, _and_ his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. ^10

11 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up _their_ _voice_, the villages _that_ Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. ^11

12 Let them give glory unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and declare his praise in the islands. ^12

13 The $L{\small ORD}$ shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. ^13

14 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, _and_ refrained myself: _now_ will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once. ^14

15 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. ^15

16 And I will bring the blind by a way _that_ they knew not; I will lead them in paths _that_ they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. ^16

17 ¶ They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye _are_ our gods. ^17

18 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. ^18

19 Who _is_ blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger _that_ I sent? who _is_ blind as _he_ _that_ _is_ perfect, and blind as the $L{\small ORD}$'s servant? ^19

20 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not. ^20

21 The $L{\small ORD}$ is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make _it_ honourable. ^21

22 But this _is_ a people robbed and spoiled; _they_ _are_ all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. ^22

23 Who among you will give ear to this? _who_ will hearken and hear for the time to come? ^23

24 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the $L{\small ORD}$, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law. ^24

25 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid _it_ not to heart. ^25
