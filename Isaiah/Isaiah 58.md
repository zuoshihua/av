### Isaiah 58

1 CRY aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. ^1

2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. ^2

3 ¶ Wherefore have we fasted, _say_ _they_, and thou seest not? _wherefore_ have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. ^3

4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as _ye_ _do_ _this_ day, to make your voice to be heard on high. ^4

5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? _is_ _it_ to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes _under_ _him?_ wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the $L{\small ORD}$? ^5

6 _Is_ not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? ^6

7 _Is_ _it_ not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? ^7

8 ¶ Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be thy rereward. ^8

9 Then shalt thou call, and the $L{\small ORD}$ shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I _am_. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; ^9

10 And _if_ thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness _be_ as the noonday: ^10

11 And the $L{\small ORD}$ shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. ^11

12 And _they_ _that_ _shall_ _be_ of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. ^12

13 ¶ If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, _from_ doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the $L{\small ORD}$, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking _thine_ _own_ words: ^13

14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the $L{\small ORD}$; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken _it_. ^14
