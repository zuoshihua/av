### Isaiah 52

1 AWAKE, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. ^1

2 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, _and_ sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. ^2

3 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money. ^3

4 For thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. ^4

5 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; and my name continually every day _is_ blasphemed. ^5

6 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore _they_ _shall_ _know_ in that day that I _am_ he that doth speak: behold, _it_ _is_ I. ^6

7 ¶ How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! ^7

8 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the $L{\small ORD}$ shall bring again Zion. ^8

9 ¶ Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. ^9

10 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God. ^10

11 ¶ Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean _thing;_ go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^11

12 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the $L{\small ORD}$ will go before you; and the God of Israel _will_ _be_ your rereward. ^12

13 ¶ Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. ^13

14 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: ^14

15 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for _that_ which had not been told them shall they see; and _that_ which they had not heard shall they consider. ^15
