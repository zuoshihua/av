### Isaiah 16

1 SEND ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion. ^1

2 For it shall be, _that_, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, _so_ the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon. ^2

3 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. ^3

4 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. ^4

5 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness. ^5

6 ¶ We have heard of the pride of Moab; _he_ _is_ very proud: _even_ of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: _but_ his lies _shall_ not _be_ so. ^6

7 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely _they_ _are_ stricken. ^7

8 For the fields of Heshbon languish, _and_ the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come _even_ unto Jazer, they wandered _through_ the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea. ^8

9 ¶ Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen. ^9

10 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in _their_ presses; I have made _their_ _vintage_ shouting to cease. ^10

11 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh. ^11

12 ¶ And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail. ^12

13 This _is_ the word that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken concerning Moab since that time. ^13

14 But now the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant _shall_ _be_ very small _and_ feeble. ^14
