### Isaiah 48

1 HEAR ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, and make mention of the God of Israel, _but_ not in truth, nor in righteousness. ^1

2 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ his name. ^2

3 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did _them_ suddenly, and they came to pass. ^3

4 Because I knew that thou _art_ obstinate, and thy neck _is_ an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; ^4

5 I have even from the beginning declared _it_ to thee; before it came to pass I shewed _it_ thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. ^5

6 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare _it?_ I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them. ^6

7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. ^7

8 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time _that_ thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb. ^8

9 ¶ For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. ^9

10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. ^10

11 For mine own sake, _even_ for mine own sake, will I do _it:_ for how should _my_ _name_ be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another. ^11

12 ¶ Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I _am_ he; I _am_ the first, I also _am_ the last. ^12

13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: _when_ I call unto them, they stand up together. ^13

14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these _things?_ The $L{\small ORD}$ hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm _shall_ _be_ _on_ the Chaldeans. ^14

15 I, _even_ I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. ^15

16 ¶ Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there _am_ I: and now the Lord $G{\small OD}$, and his Spirit, hath sent me. ^16

17 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way _that_ thou shouldest go. ^17

18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: ^18

19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me. ^19

20 ¶ Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it _even_ to the end of the earth; say ye, The $L{\small ORD}$ hath redeemed his servant Jacob. ^20

21 And they thirsted not _when_ he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out. ^21

22 _There_ _is_ no peace, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, unto the wicked. ^22
