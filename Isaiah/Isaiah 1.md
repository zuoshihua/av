### Isaiah 1

1 THE vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah, kings of Judah. ^1

2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. ^2

3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: _but_ Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. ^3

4 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the $L{\small ORD}$, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward. ^4

5 ¶ Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. ^5

6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head _there_ _is_ no soundness in it; _but_ wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment. ^6

7 Your country _is_ desolate, your cities _are_ burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and _it_ _is_ desolate, as overthrown by strangers. ^7

8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. ^8

9 Except the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, _and_ we should have been like unto Gomorrah. ^9

10 ¶ Hear the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. ^10

11 To what purpose _is_ the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the $L{\small ORD}$: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. ^11

12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? ^12

13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; _it_ _is_ iniquity, even the solemn meeting. ^13

14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear _them_. ^14

15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. ^15

16 ¶ Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; ^16

17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. ^17

18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. ^18

19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: ^19

20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken _it_. ^20

21 ¶ How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. ^21

22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: ^22

23 Thy princes _are_ rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. ^23

24 Therefore saith the Lord, the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies: ^24

25 ¶ And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: ^25

26 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellers as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city. ^26

27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness. ^27

28 ¶ And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners _shall_ _be_ together, and they that forsake the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be consumed. ^28

29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. ^29

30 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. ^30

31 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench _them_. ^31
