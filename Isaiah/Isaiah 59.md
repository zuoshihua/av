### Isaiah 59

1 BEHOLD, the $L{\small ORD}$'s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: ^1

2 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid _his_ face from you, that he will not hear. ^2

3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. ^3

4 None calleth for justice, nor _any_ pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. ^4

5 They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. ^5

6 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works _are_ works of iniquity, and the act of violence _is_ in their hands. ^6

7 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts _are_ thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction _are_ in their paths. ^7

8 The way of peace they know not; and _there_ _is_ no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace. ^8

9 ¶ Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, _but_ we walk in darkness. ^9

10 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if _we_ _had_ no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; _we_ _are_ in desolate places as dead _men_. ^10

11 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but _there_ _is_ none; for salvation, _but_ it is far off from us. ^11

12 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions _are_ with us; and _as_ _for_ our iniquities, we know them; ^12

13 In transgressing and lying against the $L{\small ORD}$, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. ^13

14 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. ^14

15 Yea, truth faileth; and he _that_ departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the $L{\small ORD}$ saw _it_, and it displeased him that _there_ _was_ no judgment. ^15

16 ¶ And he saw that _there_ _was_ no man, and wondered that _there_ _was_ no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. ^16

17 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance _for_ clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. ^17

18 According to _their_ deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. ^18

19 So shall they fear the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall lift up a standard against him. ^19

20 ¶ And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20

21 As for me, this _is_ my covenant with them, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; My spirit that _is_ upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, from henceforth and for ever. ^21
