### Isaiah 25

1 O LORD, thou _art_ my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful _things;_ _thy_ counsels of old _are_ faithfulness _and_ truth. ^1

2 For thou hast made of a city an heap; _of_ a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built. ^2

3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. ^3

4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones _is_ as a storm _against_ the wall. ^4

5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; _even_ the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low. ^5

6 ¶ And in this mountain shall the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. ^6

7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. ^7

8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord $G{\small OD}$ will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken _it_. ^8

9 ¶ And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this _is_ our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. ^9

10 For in this mountain shall the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill. ^10

11 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth _his_ _hands_ to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. ^11

12 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, _and_ bring to the ground, _even_ to the dust. ^12
