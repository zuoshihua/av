### Isaiah 5

1 NOW will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: ^1

2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. ^2

3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. ^3

4 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? ^4

5 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; _and_ break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: ^5

6 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. ^6

7 For the vineyard of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry. ^7

8 ¶ Woe unto them that join house to house, _that_ lay field to field, till _there_ _be_ no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth! ^8

9 In mine ears _said_ the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, _even_ great and fair, without inhabitant. ^9

10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah. ^10

11 ¶ Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, _that_ they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, _till_ wine inflame them! ^11

12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the $L{\small ORD}$, neither consider the operation of his hands. ^12

13 ¶ Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because _they_ _have_ no knowledge: and their honourable men _are_ famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst. ^13

14 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it. ^14

15 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled: ^15

16 But the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness. ^16

17 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat. ^17

18 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope: ^18

19 That say, Let him make speed, _and_ hasten his work, that we may see _it:_ and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know _it!_ ^19

20 ¶ Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! ^20

21 Woe unto _them_ _that_ _are_ wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! ^21

22 Woe unto _them_ _that_ _are_ mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: ^22

23 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! ^23

24 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, _so_ their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. ^24

25 Therefore is the anger of the $L{\small ORD}$ kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases _were_ torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand _is_ stretched out still. ^25

26 ¶ And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly: ^26

27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: ^27

28 Whose arrows _are_ sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: ^28

29 Their roaring _shall_ _be_ like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry _it_ away safe, and none shall deliver _it_. ^29

30 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if _one_ look unto the land, behold darkness _and_ sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof. ^30
