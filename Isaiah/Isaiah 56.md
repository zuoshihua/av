### Isaiah 56

1 THUS saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation _is_ near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. ^1

2 Blessed _is_ the man _that_ doeth this, and the son of man _that_ layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. ^2

3 ¶ Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the $L{\small ORD}$, speak, saying, The $L{\small ORD}$ hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I _am_ a dry tree. ^3

4 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose _the_ _things_ that please me, and take hold of my covenant; ^4

5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. ^5

6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the $L{\small ORD}$, to serve him, and to love the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; ^6

7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices _shall_ _be_ accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people. ^7

8 The Lord $G{\small OD}$ which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather _others_ to him, beside those that are gathered unto him. ^8

9 ¶ All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, _yea_, all ye beasts in the forest. ^9

10 His watchmen _are_ blind: they are all ignorant, they _are_ all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. ^10

11 Yea, _they_ _are_ greedy dogs _which_ can never have enough, and they _are_ shepherds _that_ cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter. ^11

12 Come ye, _say_ _they_, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, _and_ much more abundant. ^12
