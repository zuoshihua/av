### Isaiah 13

1 THE burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. ^1

2 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. ^2

3 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, _even_ them that rejoice in my highness. ^3

4 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. ^4

5 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, _even_ the $L{\small ORD}$, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. ^5

6 ¶ Howl ye; for the day of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. ^6

7 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt: ^7

8 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces _shall_ _be_ _as_ flames. ^8

9 Behold, the day of the $L{\small ORD}$ cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. ^9

10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. ^10

11 And I will punish the world for _their_ evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. ^11

12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. ^12

13 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. ^13

14 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land. ^14

15 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined _unto_ _them_ shall fall by the sword. ^15

16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. ^16

17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and _as_ _for_ gold, they shall not delight in it. ^17

18 _Their_ bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children. ^18

19 ¶ And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. ^19

20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. ^20

21 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. ^21

22 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in _their_ pleasant palaces: and her time _is_ near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged. ^22
