### Isaiah 62

1 FOR Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp _that_ burneth. ^1

2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall name. ^2

3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. ^3

4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the $L{\small ORD}$ delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. ^4

5 ¶ For _as_ a young man marrieth a virgin, _so_ shall thy sons marry thee: and _as_ the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, _so_ shall thy God rejoice over thee. ^5

6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, _which_ shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the $L{\small ORD}$, keep not silence, ^6

7 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. ^7

8 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn _to_ _be_ meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured: ^8

9 But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the $L{\small ORD}$; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness. ^9

10 ¶ Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. ^10

11 Behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward _is_ with him, and his work before him. ^11

12 And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the $L{\small ORD}$: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken. ^12
