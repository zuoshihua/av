### Isaiah 2

1 THE word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. ^1

2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, _that_ the mountain of the $L{\small ORD}$'s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. ^2

3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the $L{\small ORD}$, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ from Jerusalem. ^3

4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. ^4

5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 ¶ Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and _are_ soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. ^6

7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither _is_ _there_ _any_ end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither _is_ _there_ _any_ end of their chariots: ^7

8 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: ^8

9 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not. ^9

10 ¶ Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the $L{\small ORD}$, and for the glory of his majesty. ^10

11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the $L{\small ORD}$ alone shall be exalted in that day. ^11

12 For the day of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _shall_ _be_ upon every _one_ _that_ _is_ proud and lofty, and upon every _one_ _that_ _is_ lifted up; and he shall be brought low: ^12

13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, _that_ _are_ high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, ^13

14 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills _that_ _are_ lifted up, ^14

15 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, ^15

16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. ^16

17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the $L{\small ORD}$ alone shall be exalted in that day. ^17

18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish. ^18

19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the $L{\small ORD}$, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. ^19

20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made _each_ _one_ for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; ^20

21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the $L{\small ORD}$, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. ^21

22 Cease ye from man, whose breath _is_ in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of? ^22
