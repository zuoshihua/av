### Isaiah 46

1 BEL boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages _were_ heavy loaden; _they_ _are_ a burden to the weary _beast_. ^1

2 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. ^2

3 ¶ Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne _by_ _me_ from the belly, which are carried from the womb: ^3

4 And _even_ to _your_ old age I _am_ he; and _even_ to hoar hairs will I carry _you:_ I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver _you_. ^4

5 ¶ To whom will ye liken me, and make _me_ equal, and compare me, that we may be like? ^5

6 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, _and_ hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship. ^6

7 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, _one_ shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. ^7

8 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring _it_ again to mind, O ye transgressors. ^8

9 Remember the former things of old: for I _am_ God, and _there_ _is_ none else; _I_ _am_ God, and _there_ _is_ none like me, ^9

10 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times _the_ _things_ that are not _yet_ done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: ^10

11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken _it_, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed _it_, I will also do it. ^11

12 ¶ Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that _are_ far from righteousness: ^12

13 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory. ^13
