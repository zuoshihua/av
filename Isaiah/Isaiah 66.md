### Isaiah 66

1 THUS saith the $L{\small ORD}$, The heaven _is_ my throne, and the earth _is_ my footstool: where _is_ the house that ye build unto me? and where _is_ the place of my rest? ^1

2 For all those _things_ hath mine hand made, and all those _things_ have been, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: but to this _man_ will I look, _even_ to _him_ _that_ _is_ poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. ^2

3 He that killeth an ox _is_ _as_ _if_ he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, _as_ _if_ he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, _as_ _if_ _he_ _offered_ swine's blood; he that burneth incense, _as_ _if_ he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. ^3

4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose _that_ in which I delighted not. ^4

5 Â¶ Hear the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the $L{\small ORD}$ be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. ^5

6 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ that rendereth recompence to his enemies. ^6

7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. ^7

8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? _or_ shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. ^8

9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the $L{\small ORD}$: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut _the_ _womb?_ saith thy God. ^9

10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: ^10

11 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. ^11

12 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon _her_ sides, and be dandled upon _her_ knees. ^12

13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. ^13

14 And when ye see _this_, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be known toward his servants, and _his_ indignation toward his enemies. ^14

15 For, behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. ^15

16 For by fire and by his sword will the $L{\small ORD}$ plead with all flesh: and the slain of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall be many. ^16

17 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one _tree_ in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 For I _know_ their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory. ^18

19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, _to_ Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, _to_ Tubal, and Javan, _to_ the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. ^19

20 And they shall bring all your brethren _for_ an offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$ out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20

21 And I will also take of them for priests _and_ for Levites, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21

22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, so shall your seed and your name remain. ^22

23 And it shall come to pass, _that_ from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^23

24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh. ^24
