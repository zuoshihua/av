### Isaiah 41

1 KEEP silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew _their_ strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment. ^1

2 Who raised up the righteous _man_ from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made _him_ rule over kings? he gave _them_ as the dust to his sword, _and_ as driven stubble to his bow. ^2

3 He pursued them, _and_ passed safely; _even_ by the way _that_ he had not gone with his feet. ^3

4 Who hath wrought and done _it_, calling the generations from the beginning? I the $L{\small ORD}$, the first, and with the last; I _am_ he. ^4

5 The isles saw _it_, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came. ^5

6 They helped every one his neighbour; and _every_ _one_ said to his brother, Be of good courage. ^6

7 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, _and_ he that smootheth _with_ the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It _is_ ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, _that_ it should not be moved. ^7

8 But thou, Israel, _art_ my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend. ^8

9 _Thou_ whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou _art_ my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away. ^9

10 Â¶ Fear thou not; for I _am_ with thee: be not dismayed; for I _am_ thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. ^10

11 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish. ^11

12 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, _even_ them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. ^12

13 For I the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee. ^13

14 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, _and_ ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. ^14

15 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat _them_ small, and shalt make the hills as chaff. ^15

16 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the $L{\small ORD}$, _and_ shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. ^16

17 _When_ the poor and needy seek water, and _there_ _is_ none, _and_ their tongue faileth for thirst, I the $L{\small ORD}$ will hear them, _I_ the God of Israel will not forsake them. ^17

18 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. ^18

19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, _and_ the pine, and the box tree together: ^19

20 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it. ^20

21 Produce your cause, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; bring forth your strong _reasons_, saith the King of Jacob. ^21

22 Let them bring _them_ forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they _be_, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come. ^22

23 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye _are_ gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold _it_ together. ^23

24 Behold, ye _are_ of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination _is_ _he_ _that_ chooseth you. ^24

25 I have raised up _one_ from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as _upon_ morter, and as the potter treadeth clay. ^25

26 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, _He_ _is_ righteous? yea, _there_ _is_ none that sheweth, yea, _there_ _is_ none that declareth, yea, _there_ _is_ none that heareth your words. ^26

27 The first _shall_ _say_ to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. ^27

28 For I beheld, and _there_ _was_ no man; even among them, and _there_ _was_ no counseller, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word. ^28

29 Behold, they _are_ all vanity; their works _are_ nothing: their molten images _are_ wind and confusion. ^29
