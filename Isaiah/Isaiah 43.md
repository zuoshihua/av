### Isaiah 43

1 BUT now thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called _thee_ by thy name; thou _art_ mine. ^1

2 When thou passest through the waters, I _will_ _be_ with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. ^2

3 For I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt _for_ thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee. ^3

4 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. ^4

5 Fear not: for I _am_ with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; ^5

6 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; ^6

7 _Even_ every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him. ^7

8 ¶ Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. ^8

9 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, _It_ _is_ truth. ^9

10 Ye _are_ my witnesses, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I _am_ he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. ^10

11 I, _even_ I, _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$; and beside me _there_ _is_ no saviour. ^11

12 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when _there_ _was_ no strange _god_ among you: therefore ye _are_ my witnesses, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that I _am_ God. ^12

13 Yea, before the day _was_ I _am_ he; and _there_ _is_ none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? ^13

14 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry _is_ in the ships. ^14

15 I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King. ^15

16 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters; ^16

17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow. ^17

18 ¶ Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. ^18

19 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, _and_ rivers in the desert. ^19

20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, _and_ rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. ^20

21 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. ^21

22 ¶ But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel. ^22

23 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. ^23

24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. ^24

25 I, _even_ I, _am_ he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. ^25

26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified. ^26

27 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me. ^27

28 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches. ^28
