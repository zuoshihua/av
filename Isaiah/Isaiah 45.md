### Isaiah 45

1 THUS saith the $L{\small ORD}$ to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut; ^1

2 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: ^2

3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the $L{\small ORD}$, which call _thee_ by thy name, _am_ the God of Israel. ^3

4 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me. ^4

5 ¶ I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, and _there_ _is_ none else, _there_ _is_ no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: ^5

6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that _there_ _is_ none beside me. I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, and _there_ _is_ none else. ^6

7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the $L{\small ORD}$ do all these _things_. ^7

8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the $L{\small ORD}$ have created it. ^8

9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! _Let_ the potsherd _strive_ with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? ^9

10 Woe unto him that saith unto _his_ father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth? ^10

11 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me. ^11

12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, _even_ my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. ^12

13 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^13

14 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, _saying_, Surely God _is_ in thee; and _there_ _is_ none else, _there_ _is_ no God. ^14

15 Verily thou _art_ a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour. ^15

16 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together _that_ _are_ makers of idols. ^16

17 _But_ Israel shall be saved in the $L{\small ORD}$ with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. ^17

18 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$; and _there_ _is_ none else. ^18

19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the $L{\small ORD}$ speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. ^19

20 ¶ Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye _that_ _are_ escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god _that_ cannot save. ^20

21 Tell ye, and bring _them_ near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? _who_ hath told it from that time? _have_ not I the $L{\small ORD}$? and _there_ _is_ no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; _there_ _is_ none beside me. ^21

22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I _am_ God, and _there_ _is_ none else. ^22

23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth _in_ righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. ^23

24 Surely, shall _one_ say, in the $L{\small ORD}$ have I righteousness and strength: _even_ to him shall _men_ come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed. ^24

25 In the $L{\small ORD}$ shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory. ^25
