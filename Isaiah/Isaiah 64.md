### Isaiah 64

1 OH that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, ^1

2 As _when_ the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, _that_ the nations may tremble at thy presence! ^2

3 When thou didst terrible things _which_ we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. ^3

4 For since the beginning of the world _men_ have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, _what_ he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. ^4

5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, _those_ _that_ remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. ^5

6 But we are all as an unclean _thing_, and all our righteousnesses _are_ as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. ^6

7 And _there_ _is_ none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. ^7

8 But now, O $L{\small ORD}$, thou _art_ our father; we _are_ the clay, and thou our potter; and we all _are_ the work of thy hand. ^8

9 Â¶ Be not wroth very sore, O $L{\small ORD}$, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we _are_ all thy people. ^9

10 Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. ^10

11 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste. ^11

12 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these _things_, O $L{\small ORD}$? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore? ^12
