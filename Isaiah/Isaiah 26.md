### Isaiah 26

1 IN that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will _God_ appoint _for_ walls and bulwarks. ^1

2 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. ^2

3 Thou wilt keep _him_ in perfect peace, _whose_ mind _is_ stayed _on_ _thee:_ because he trusteth in thee. ^3

4 Trust ye in the $L{\small ORD}$ for ever: for in the $L{\small ORD}$ JEHOVAH _is_ everlasting strength: ^4

5 ¶ For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, _even_ to the ground; he bringeth it _even_ to the dust. ^5

6 The foot shall tread it down, _even_ the feet of the poor, _and_ the steps of the needy. ^6

7 The way of the just _is_ uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just. ^7

8 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O $L{\small ORD}$, have we waited for thee; the desire of _our_ soul _is_ to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. ^8

9 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments _are_ in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. ^9

10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, _yet_ will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 $L{\small ORD}$, _when_ thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: _but_ they shall see, and be ashamed for _their_ envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them. ^11

12 ¶ $L{\small ORD}$, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us. ^12

13 O $L{\small ORD}$ our God, _other_ lords beside thee have had dominion over us: _but_ by thee only will we make mention of thy name. ^13

14 _They_ _are_ dead, they shall not live; _they_ _are_ deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish. ^14

15 Thou hast increased the nation, O $L{\small ORD}$, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed _it_ far _unto_ all the ends of the earth. ^15

16 $L{\small ORD}$, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer _when_ thy chastening _was_ upon them. ^16

17 Like as a woman with child, _that_ draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, _and_ crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen. ^18

19 Thy dead _men_ shall live, _together_ _with_ my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew _is_ _as_ the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. ^19

20 ¶ Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. ^20

21 For, behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. ^21
