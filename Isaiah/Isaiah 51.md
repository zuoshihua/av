### Isaiah 51

1 HEARKEN to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the $L{\small ORD}$: look unto the rock _whence_ ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit _whence_ ye are digged. ^1

2 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah _that_ bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him. ^2

3 For the $L{\small ORD}$ shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the $L{\small ORD}$; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. ^3

4 ¶ Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people. ^4

5 My righteousness _is_ near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust. ^5

6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. ^6

7 ¶ Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart _is_ my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings. ^7

8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation. ^8

9 ¶ Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the $L{\small ORD}$; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. _Art_ thou not it that hath cut Rahab, _and_ wounded the dragon? ^9

10 _Art_ thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? ^10

11 Therefore the redeemed of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy _shall_ _be_ upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; _and_ sorrow and mourning shall flee away. ^11

12 I, _even_ I, _am_ he that comforteth you: who _art_ thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man _that_ shall die, and of the son of man _which_ shall be made _as_ grass; ^12

13 And forgettest the $L{\small ORD}$ thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where _is_ the fury of the oppressor? ^13

14 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. ^14

15 But I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ his name. ^15

16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou _art_ my people. ^16

17 ¶ Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, _and_ wrung _them_ out. ^17

18 _There_ _is_ none to guide her among all the sons _whom_ she hath brought forth; neither _is_ _there_ _any_ that taketh her by the hand of all the sons _that_ she hath brought up. ^18

19 These two _things_ are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee? ^19

20 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the $L{\small ORD}$, the rebuke of thy God. ^20

21 ¶ Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: ^21

22 Thus saith thy Lord the $L{\small ORD}$, and thy God _that_ pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, _even_ the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again: ^22

23 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over. ^23
