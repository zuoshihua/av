### Isaiah 47

1 COME down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: _there_ _is_ no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. ^1

2 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. ^2

3 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet _thee_ _as_ a man. ^3

4 _As_ _for_ our redeemer, the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ his name, the Holy One of Israel. ^4

5 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms. ^5

6 ¶ I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. ^6

7 ¶ And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: _so_ that thou didst not lay these _things_ to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it. ^7

8 Therefore hear now this, _thou_ _that_ _art_ given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I _am_, and none else beside me; I shall not sit _as_ a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children: ^8

9 But these two _things_ shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, _and_ for the great abundance of thine enchantments. ^9

10 ¶ For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I _am_, and none else beside me. ^10

11 ¶ Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, _which_ thou shalt not know. ^11

12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. ^12

13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from _these_ _things_ that shall come upon thee. ^13

14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: _there_ _shall_ not _be_ a coal to warm at, _nor_ fire to sit before it. ^14

15 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, _even_ thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee. ^15
