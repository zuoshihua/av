### Isaiah 35

1 THE wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. ^1

2 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$, _and_ the excellency of our God. ^2

3 Â¶ Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. ^3

4 Say to them _that_ _are_ of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come _with_ vengeance, _even_ God _with_ a recompence; he will come and save you. ^4

5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. ^5

6 Then shall the lame _man_ leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. ^6

7 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, _shall_ _be_ grass with reeds and rushes. ^7

8 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it _shall_ _be_ for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err _therein_. ^8

9 No lion shall be there, nor _any_ ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk _there:_ ^9

10 And the ransomed of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. ^10
