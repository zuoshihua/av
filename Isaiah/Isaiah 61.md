### Isaiah 61

1 THE Spirit of the Lord $G{\small OD}$ _is_ upon me; because the $L{\small ORD}$ hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to _them_ _that_ _are_ bound; ^1

2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the $L{\small ORD}$, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; ^2

3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the $L{\small ORD}$, that he might be glorified. ^3

4 ¶ And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. ^4

5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien _shall_ _be_ your plowmen and your vinedressers. ^5

6 But ye shall be named the Priests of the $L{\small ORD}$: _men_ shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. ^6

7 ¶ For your shame _ye_ _shall_ _have_ double; and _for_ confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them. ^7

8 For I the $L{\small ORD}$ love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. ^8

9 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they _are_ the seed _which_ the $L{\small ORD}$ hath blessed. ^9

10 I will greatly rejoice in the $L{\small ORD}$, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh _himself_ with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth _herself_ with her jewels. ^10

11 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord $G{\small OD}$ will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. ^11
