### Isaiah 3

1 FOR, behold, the Lord, the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, ^1

2 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, ^2

3 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counseller, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. ^3

4 And I will give children _to_ _be_ their princes, and babes shall rule over them. ^4

5 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable. ^5

6 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, _saying_, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and _let_ this ruin _be_ under thy hand: ^6

7 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house _is_ neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. ^7

8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings _are_ against the $L{\small ORD}$, to provoke the eyes of his glory. ^8

9 ¶ The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide _it_ not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. ^9

10 Say ye to the righteous, that _it_ _shall_ _be_ well _with_ _him:_ for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. ^10

11 Woe unto the wicked! _it_ _shall_ _be_ ill _with_ _him:_ for the reward of his hands shall be given him. ^11

12 ¶ _As_ _for_ my people, children _are_ their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause _thee_ to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. ^12

13 The $L{\small ORD}$ standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. ^13

14 The $L{\small ORD}$ will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor _is_ in your houses. ^14

15 What mean ye _that_ ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$ of hosts. ^15

16 ¶ Moreover the $L{\small ORD}$ saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing _as_ they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: ^16

17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the $L{\small ORD}$ will discover their secret parts. ^17

18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of _their_ tinkling ornaments _about_ _their_ _feet_, and _their_ cauls, and _their_ round tires like the moon, ^18

19 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, ^19

20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, ^20

21 The rings, and nose jewels, ^21

22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, ^22

23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. ^23

24 And it shall come to pass, _that_ instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; _and_ burning instead of beauty. ^24

25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. ^25

26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she _being_ desolate shall sit upon the ground. ^26
