### 2 Kings 19

1 AND it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard _it_, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^1

2 And he sent Eliakim, which _was_ over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. ^2

3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day _is_ a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and _there_ _is_ not strength to bring forth. ^3

4 It may be the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up _thy_ prayer for the remnant that are left. ^4

5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. ^5

6 ¶ And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. ^6

7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. ^7

8 ¶ So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. ^8

9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying, ^9

10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. ^10

11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? ^11

12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; _as_ Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which _were_ in Thelasar? ^12

13 Where _is_ the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? ^13

14 ¶ And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and spread it before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 And Hezekiah prayed before the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, O $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel, which dwellest _between_ the cherubims, thou art the God, _even_ thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. ^15

16 $L{\small ORD}$, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, $L{\small ORD}$, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. ^16

17 Of a truth, $L{\small ORD}$, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands, ^17

18 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they _were_ no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. ^18

19 Now therefore, O $L{\small ORD}$ our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou _art_ the $L{\small ORD}$ God, _even_ thou only. ^19

20 ¶ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel, _That_ which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. ^20

21 This _is_ the word that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, _and_ laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. ^21

22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted _thy_ voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? _even_ against the Holy _One_ of Israel. ^22

23 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, _and_ the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, _and_ _into_ the forest of his Carmel. ^23

24 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places. ^24

25 Hast thou not heard long ago _how_ I have done it, _and_ of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities _into_ ruinous heaps. ^25

26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were _as_ the grass of the field, and _as_ the green herb, _as_ the grass on the housetops, and _as_ _corn_ blasted before it be grown up. ^26

27 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. ^27

28 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. ^28

29 And this _shall_ _be_ a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof. ^29

30 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. ^30

31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the $L{\small ORD}$ _of_ _hosts_ shall do this. ^31

32 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. ^32

33 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^33

34 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. ^34

35 ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they _were_ all dead corpses. ^35

36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. ^36

37 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. ^37
