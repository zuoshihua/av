### 2 Kings 20

1 IN those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. ^1

2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the $L{\small ORD}$, saying, ^2

3 I beseech thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done _that_ _which_ _is_ good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. ^3

4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came to him, saying, ^4

5 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. ^6

7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid _it_ on the boil, and he recovered. ^7

8 ¶ And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What _shall_ _be_ the sign that the $L{\small ORD}$ will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ the third day? ^8

9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the $L{\small ORD}$, that the $L{\small ORD}$ will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? ^9

10 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. ^10

11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz. ^11

12 ¶ At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. ^12

13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and _all_ the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. ^13

14 ¶ Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, _even_ from Babylon. ^14

15 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All _the_ _things_ that _are_ in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. ^15

16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 Behold, the days come, that all that _is_ in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. ^18

19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good _is_ the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ which thou hast spoken. And he said, _Is_ _it_ not _good_, if peace and truth be in my days? ^19

20 ¶ And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, _are_ they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? ^20

21 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead. ^21
