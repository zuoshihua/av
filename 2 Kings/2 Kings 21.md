### 2 Kings 21

1 MANASSEH _was_ twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name _was_ Hephzi-bah. ^1

2 And he did _that_ _which_ _was_ evil in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the $L{\small ORD}$ cast out before the children of Israel. ^2

3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. ^3

4 And he built altars in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, of which the $L{\small ORD}$ said, In Jerusalem will I put my name. ^4

5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, to provoke _him_ to anger. ^6

7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the $L{\small ORD}$ said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: ^7

8 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them. ^8

9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the $L{\small ORD}$ destroyed before the children of Israel. ^9

10 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ spake by his servants the prophets, saying, ^10

11 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, _and_ hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which _were_ before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: ^11

12 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel, Behold, I _am_ bringing _such_ evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. ^12

13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as _a_ _man_ wipeth a dish, wiping _it_, and turning _it_ upside down. ^13

14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; ^14

15 Because they have done _that_ _which_ _was_ evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day. ^15

16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing _that_ _which_ _was_ evil in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, _are_ they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? ^17

18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. ^18

19 ¶ Amon _was_ twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name _was_ Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. ^19

20 And he did _that_ _which_ _was_ evil in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, as his father Manasseh did. ^20

21 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: ^21

22 And he forsook the $L{\small ORD}$ God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^22

23 ¶ And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house. ^23

24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. ^24

25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, _are_ they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? ^25

26 And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead. ^26
