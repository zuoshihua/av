### 2 Kings 18

1 NOW it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, _that_ Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. ^1

2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also _was_ Abi, the daughter of Zachariah. ^2

3 And he did _that_ _which_ _was_ right in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, according to all that David his father did. ^3

4 ¶ He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. ^4

5 He trusted in the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor _any_ that were before him. ^5

6 For he clave to the $L{\small ORD}$, _and_ departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses. ^6

7 And the $L{\small ORD}$ was with him; _and_ he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not. ^7

8 He smote the Philistines, _even_ unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. ^8

9 ¶ And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which _was_ the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, _that_ Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. ^9

10 And at the end of three years they took it: _even_ in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that _is_ the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. ^10

11 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor _by_ the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes: ^11

12 Because they obeyed not the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ their God, but transgressed his covenant, _and_ all that Moses the servant of the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded, and would not hear _them_, nor do _them_. ^12

13 ¶ Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. ^13

14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. ^14

15 And Hezekiah gave _him_ all the silver that was found in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and in the treasures of the king's house. ^15

16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off _the_ _gold_ _from_ the doors of the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$, and _from_ the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. ^16

17 ¶ And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which _is_ in the highway of the fuller's field. ^17

18 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which _was_ over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. ^18

19 And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence _is_ this wherein thou trustest? ^19

20 Thou sayest, (but _they_ _are_ _but_ vain words,) _I_ _have_ counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? ^20

21 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, _even_ upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so _is_ Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him. ^21

22 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the $L{\small ORD}$ our God: _is_ not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? ^22

23 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. ^23

24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? ^24

25 Am I now come up without the $L{\small ORD}$ against this place to destroy it? The $L{\small ORD}$ said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. ^25

26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand _it:_ and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that _are_ on the wall. ^26

27 But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? _hath_ _he_ not _sent_ _me_ to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you? ^27

28 Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria: ^28

29 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand: ^29

30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the $L{\small ORD}$, saying, The $L{\small ORD}$ will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. ^30

31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make _an_ _agreement_ with me by a present, and come out to me, and _then_ eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern: ^31

32 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The $L{\small ORD}$ will deliver us. ^32

33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? ^33

34 Where _are_ the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where _are_ the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand? ^34

35 Who _are_ they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the $L{\small ORD}$ should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand? ^35

36 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. ^36

37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which _was_ over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with _their_ clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh. ^37
