### Ezra 1

1 NOW in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the $L{\small ORD}$ stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and _put_ _it_ also in writing, saying, ^1

2 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The $L{\small ORD}$ God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which _is_ in Judah. ^2

3 Who _is_ _there_ among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which _is_ in Judah, and build the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel, (he _is_ the God,) which _is_ in Jerusalem. ^3

4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that _is_ in Jerusalem. ^4

5 ¶ Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all _them_ whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ which _is_ in Jerusalem. ^5

6 And all they that _were_ about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all _that_ was willingly offered. ^6

7 ¶ Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; ^7

8 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. ^8

9 And this _is_ the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, ^9

10 Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second _sort_ four hundred and ten, _and_ other vessels a thousand. ^10

11 All the vessels of gold and of silver _were_ five thousand and four hundred. All _these_ did Sheshbazzar bring up with _them_ _of_ the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. ^11
