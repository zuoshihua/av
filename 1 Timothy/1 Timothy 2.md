### 1 Timothy 2

1 I EXHORT therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, _and_ giving of thanks, be made for all men; ^1

2 For kings, and _for_ all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. ^2

3 For this _is_ good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; ^3

4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. ^4

5 For _there_ _is_ one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; ^5

6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. ^6

7 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, _and_ lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. ^7

8 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. ^8

9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; ^9

10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. ^10

11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. ^11

12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. ^12

13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve. ^13

14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. ^14

15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. ^15
