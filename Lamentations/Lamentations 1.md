### Lamentations 1

1 HOW doth the city sit solitary, _that_ _was_ full of people! _how_ is she become as a widow! she _that_ _was_ great among the nations, _and_ princess among the provinces, _how_ is she become tributary! ^1

2 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears _are_ on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort _her:_ all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. ^2

3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits. ^3

4 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she _is_ in bitterness. ^4

5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy. ^5

6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts _that_ find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. ^6

7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, _and_ did mock at her sabbaths. ^7

8 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. ^8

9 Her filthiness _is_ in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O $L{\small ORD}$, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified _himself_. ^9

10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen _that_ the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command _that_ they should not enter into thy congregation. ^10

11 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O $L{\small ORD}$, and consider; for I am become vile. ^11

12 ¶ _Is_ _it_ nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the $L{\small ORD}$ hath afflicted _me_ in the day of his fierce anger. ^12

13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate _and_ faint all the day. ^13

14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, _and_ come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into _their_ hands, _from_ _whom_ I am not able to rise up. ^14

15 The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty _men_ in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, _as_ in a winepress. ^15

16 For these _things_ I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed. ^16

17 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, _and_ _there_ _is_ none to comfort her: the $L{\small ORD}$ hath commanded concerning Jacob, _that_ his adversaries _should_ _be_ round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them. ^17

18 ¶ The $L{\small ORD}$ is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. ^18

19 I called for my lovers, _but_ they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls. ^19

20 Behold, O $L{\small ORD}$; for I _am_ in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home _there_ _is_ as death. ^20

21 They have heard that I sigh: _there_ _is_ none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done _it:_ thou wilt bring the day _that_ thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me. ^21

22 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs _are_ many, and my heart _is_ faint. ^22
