### Lamentations 3

1 I _AM_ the man _that_ hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. ^1

2 He hath led me, and brought _me_ _into_ darkness, but not _into_ light. ^2

3 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand _against_ _me_ all the day. ^3

4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. ^4

5 He hath builded against me, and compassed _me_ with gall and travail. ^5

6 He hath set me in dark places, as _they_ _that_ _be_ dead of old. ^6

7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. ^7

8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. ^8

9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. ^9

10 He _was_ unto me _as_ a bear lying in wait, _and_ _as_ a lion in secret places. ^10

11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. ^11

12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. ^12

13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. ^13

14 I was a derision to all my people; _and_ their song all the day. ^14

15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. ^15

16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. ^16

17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. ^17

18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the $L{\small ORD}$: ^18

19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. ^19

20 My soul hath _them_ still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. ^20

21 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. ^21

22 ¶ _It_ _is_ _of_ the $L{\small ORD}$'s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. ^22

23 _They_ _are_ new every morning: great _is_ thy faithfulness. ^23

24 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. ^24

25 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ good unto them that wait for him, to the soul _that_ seeketh him. ^25

26 _It_ _is_ good that _a_ _man_ should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^26

27 _It_ _is_ good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. ^27

28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne _it_ upon him. ^28

29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. ^29

30 He giveth _his_ cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. ^30

31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever: ^31

32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. ^32

33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. ^33

34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, ^34

35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, ^35

36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. ^36

37 ¶ Who _is_ he _that_ saith, and it cometh to pass, _when_ the Lord commandeth _it_ not? ^37

38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? ^38

39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? ^39

40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the $L{\small ORD}$. ^40

41 Let us lift up our heart with _our_ hands unto God in the heavens. ^41

42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. ^42

43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. ^43

44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that _our_ prayer should not pass through. ^44

45 Thou hast made us _as_ the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. ^45

46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. ^46

47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. ^47

48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. ^48

49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, ^49

50 Till the $L{\small ORD}$ look down, and behold from heaven. ^50

51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. ^51

52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. ^52

53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. ^53

54 Waters flowed over mine head; _then_ I said, I am cut off. ^54

55 ¶ I called upon thy name, O $L{\small ORD}$, out of the low dungeon. ^55

56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. ^56

57 Thou drewest near in the day _that_ I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. ^57

58 O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. ^58

59 O $L{\small ORD}$, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. ^59

60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance _and_ all their imaginations against me. ^60

61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O $L{\small ORD}$, _and_ all their imaginations against me; ^61

62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. ^62

63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I _am_ their musick. ^63

64 ¶ Render unto them a recompence, O $L{\small ORD}$, according to the work of their hands. ^64

65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. ^65

66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^66
