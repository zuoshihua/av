### Lamentations 5

1 REMEMBER, O $L{\small ORD}$, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. ^1

2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. ^2

3 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers _are_ as widows. ^3

4 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. ^4

5 Our necks _are_ under persecution: we labour, _and_ have no rest. ^5

6 We have given the hand _to_ the Egyptians, _and_ _to_ the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. ^6

7 Our fathers have sinned, _and_ _are_ not; and we have borne their iniquities. ^7

8 Servants have ruled over us: _there_ _is_ none that doth deliver _us_ out of their hand. ^8

9 We gat our bread with _the_ _peril_ _of_ our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. ^9

10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. ^10

11 They ravished the women in Zion, _and_ the maids in the cities of Judah. ^11

12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. ^12

13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. ^13

14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. ^14

15 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. ^15

16 The crown is fallen _from_ our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned! ^16

17 For this our heart is faint; for these _things_ our eyes are dim. ^17

18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. ^18

19 Thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. ^19

20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, _and_ forsake us so long time? ^20

21 Turn thou us unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. ^21

22 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us. ^22
