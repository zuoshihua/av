### Job 10

1 MY soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. ^1

2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. ^2

3 _Is_ _it_ good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? ^3

4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? ^4

5 _Are_ thy days as the days of man? _are_ thy years as man's days, ^5

6 That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? ^6

7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and _there_ _is_ none that can deliver out of thine hand. ^7

8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. ^8

9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? ^9

10 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? ^10

11 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. ^11

12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. ^12

13 And these _things_ hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this _is_ with thee. ^13

14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. ^14

15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and _if_ I be righteous, _yet_ will I not lift up my head. _I_ _am_ full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; ^15

16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me. ^16

17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war _are_ against me. ^17

18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! ^18

19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. ^19

20 _Are_ not my days few? cease _then_, _and_ let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, ^20

21 Before I go _whence_ I shall not return, _even_ to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; ^21

22 A land of darkness, as darkness _itself;_ _and_ of the shadow of death, without any order, and _where_ the light _is_ as darkness. ^22
