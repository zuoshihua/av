### Job 35

1 ELIHU spake moreover, and said, ^1

2 Thinkest thou this to be right, _that_ thou saidst, My righteousness _is_ more than God's? ^2

3 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? _and_, What profit shall I have, _if_ _I_ _be_ _cleansed_ from my sin? ^3

4 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. ^4

5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds _which_ are higher than thou. ^5

6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or _if_ thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? ^6

7 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? ^7

8 Thy wickedness _may_ _hurt_ a man as thou _art;_ and thy righteousness _may_ _profit_ the son of man. ^8

9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make _the_ _oppressed_ to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. ^9

10 But none saith, Where _is_ God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; ^10

11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? ^11

12 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. ^12

13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. ^13

14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, _yet_ judgment _is_ before him; therefore trust thou in him. ^14

15 But now, because _it_ _is_ not _so_, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth _it_ not in great extremity: ^15

16 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. ^16
