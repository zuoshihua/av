### Job 21

1 BUT Job answered and said, ^1

2 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. ^2

3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. ^3

4 As for me, _is_ my complaint to man? and if _it_ _were_ _so_, why should not my spirit be troubled? ^4

5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay _your_ hand upon _your_ mouth. ^5

6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. ^6

7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? ^7

8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. ^8

9 Their houses _are_ safe from fear, neither _is_ the rod of God upon them. ^9

10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. ^10

11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. ^11

12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. ^12

13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. ^13

14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. ^14

15 What _is_ the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? ^15

16 Lo, their good _is_ not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^16

17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and _how_ _oft_ cometh their destruction upon them! _God_ distributeth sorrows in his anger. ^17

18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. ^18

19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know _it_. ^19

20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. ^20

21 For what pleasure _hath_ he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? ^21

22 Shall _any_ teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. ^22

23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. ^23

24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. ^24

25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. ^25

26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. ^26

27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices _which_ ye wrongfully imagine against me. ^27

28 For ye say, Where _is_ the house of the prince? and where _are_ the dwelling places of the wicked? ^28

29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, ^29

30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. ^30

31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him _what_ he hath done? ^31

32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. ^32

33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as _there_ _are_ innumerable before him. ^33

34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? ^34
