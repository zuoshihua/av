### Job 40

1 MOREOVER the $L{\small ORD}$ answered Job, and said, ^1

2 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct _him?_ he that reproveth God, let him answer it. ^2

3 ¶ Then Job answered the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, ^3

4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. ^4

5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. ^5

6 ¶ Then answered the $L{\small ORD}$ unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, ^6

7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. ^7

8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? ^8

9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? ^9

10 Deck thyself now _with_ majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. ^10

11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one _that_ _is_ proud, and abase him. ^11

12 Look on every one _that_ _is_ proud, _and_ bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. ^12

13 Hide them in the dust together; _and_ bind their faces in secret. ^13

14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. ^14

15 ¶ Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. ^15

16 Lo now, his strength _is_ in his loins, and his force _is_ in the navel of his belly. ^16

17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. ^17

18 His bones _are_ _as_ strong pieces of brass; his bones _are_ like bars of iron. ^18

19 He _is_ the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach _unto_ _him_. ^19

20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. ^20

21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. ^21

22 The shady trees cover him _with_ their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. ^22

23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, _and_ hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. ^23

24 He taketh it with his eyes: _his_ nose pierceth through snares. ^24
