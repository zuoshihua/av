### Job 34

1 FURTHERMORE Elihu answered and said, ^1

2 Hear my words, O ye wise _men;_ and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. ^2

3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. ^3

4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what _is_ good. ^4

5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. ^5

6 Should I lie against my right? my wound _is_ incurable without transgression. ^6

7 What man _is_ like Job, _who_ drinketh up scorning like water? ^7

8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. ^8

9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. ^9

10 Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, _that_ _he_ _should_ _do_ wickedness; and _from_ the Almighty, _that_ _he_ _should_ _commit_ iniquity. ^10

11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to _his_ ways. ^11

12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. ^12

13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? ^13

14 If he set his heart upon man, _if_ he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; ^14

15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. ^15

16 If now _thou_ _hast_ understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. ^16

17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? ^17

18 _Is_ _it_ _fit_ to say to a king, _Thou_ _art_ wicked? _and_ to princes, _Ye_ _are_ ungodly? ^18

19 _How_ _much_ _less_ _to_ _him_ that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all _are_ the work of his hands. ^19

20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. ^20

21 For his eyes _are_ upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. ^21

22 _There_ _is_ no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. ^22

23 For he will not lay upon man more _than_ _right;_ that he should enter into judgment with God. ^23

24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. ^24

25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth _them_ in the night, so that they are destroyed. ^25

26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; ^26

27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: ^27

28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. ^28

29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth _his_ face, who then can behold him? whether _it_ _be_ _done_ against a nation, or against a man only: ^29

30 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. ^30

31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne _chastisement_, I will not offend _any_ _more:_ ^31

32 _That_ _which_ I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. ^32

33 _Should_ _it_ _be_ according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. ^33

34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. ^34

35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words _were_ without wisdom. ^35

36 My desire _is_ _that_ Job may be tried unto the end because of _his_ answers for wicked men. ^36

37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth _his_ _hands_ among us, and multiplieth his words against God. ^37
