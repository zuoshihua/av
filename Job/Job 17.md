### Job 17

1 MY breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves _are_ _ready_ for me. ^1

2 _Are_ _there_ not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? ^2

3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who _is_ he _that_ will strike hands with me? ^3

4 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt _them_. ^4

5 He that speaketh flattery to _his_ friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. ^5

6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. ^6

7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members _are_ as a shadow. ^7

8 Upright _men_ shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. ^8

9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. ^9

10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find _one_ wise _man_ among you. ^10

11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, _even_ the thoughts of my heart. ^11

12 They change the night into day: the light _is_ short because of darkness. ^12

13 If I wait, the grave _is_ mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. ^13

14 I have said to corruption, Thou _art_ my father: to the worm, _Thou_ _art_ my mother, and my sister. ^14

15 And where _is_ now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? ^15

16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when _our_ rest together _is_ in the dust. ^16
