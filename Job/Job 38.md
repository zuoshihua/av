### Job 38

1 THEN the $L{\small ORD}$ answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, ^1

2 Who _is_ this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? ^2

3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. ^3

4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. ^4

5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? ^5

6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; ^6

7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? ^7

8 Or _who_ shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, _as_ _if_ it had issued out of the womb? ^8

9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, ^9

10 And brake up for it my decreed _place_, and set bars and doors, ^10

11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? ^11

12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; _and_ caused the dayspring to know his place; ^12

13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? ^13

14 It is turned as clay _to_ the seal; and they stand as a garment. ^14

15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken. ^15

16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? ^16

17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? ^17

18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. ^18

19 Where _is_ the way _where_ light dwelleth? and _as_ _for_ darkness, where _is_ the place thereof, ^19

20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths _to_ the house thereof? ^20

21 Knowest thou _it_, because thou wast then born? or _because_ the number of thy days _is_ great? ^21

22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, ^22

23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? ^23

24 By what way is the light parted, _which_ scattereth the east wind upon the earth? ^24

25 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; ^25

26 To cause it to rain on the earth, _where_ no man _is;_ _on_ the wilderness, wherein _there_ _is_ no man; ^26

27 To satisfy the desolate and waste _ground;_ and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? ^27

28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? ^28

29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? ^29

30 The waters are hid as _with_ a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. ^30

31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? ^31

32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? ^32

33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? ^33

34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? ^34

35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we _are?_ ^35

36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? ^36

37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, ^37

38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? ^38

39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, ^39

40 When they couch in _their_ dens, _and_ abide in the covert to lie in wait? ^40

41 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. ^41
