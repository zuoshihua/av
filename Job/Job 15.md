### Job 15

1 THEN answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, ^1

2 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? ^2

3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? ^3

4 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. ^4

5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. ^5

6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. ^6

7 _Art_ thou the first man _that_ was born? or wast thou made before the hills? ^7

8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? ^8

9 What knowest thou, that we know not? _what_ understandest thou, which _is_ not in us? ^9

10 With us _are_ both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. ^10

11 _Are_ the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? ^11

12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, ^12

13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest _such_ words go out of thy mouth? ^13

14 What _is_ man, that he should be clean? and _he_ _which_ _is_ born of a woman, that he should be righteous? ^14

15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. ^15

16 How much more abominable and filthy _is_ man, which drinketh iniquity like water? ^16

17 I will shew thee, hear me; and that _which_ I have seen I will declare; ^17

18 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid _it:_ ^18

19 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them. ^19

20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all _his_ days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. ^20

21 A dreadful sound _is_ in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. ^21

22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. ^22

23 He wandereth abroad for bread, _saying_, Where _is_ _it?_ he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. ^23

24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. ^24

25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. ^25

26 He runneth upon him, _even_ on _his_ neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: ^26

27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on _his_ flanks. ^27

28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, _and_ in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. ^28

29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. ^29

30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. ^30

31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. ^31

32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. ^32

33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. ^33

34 For the congregation of hypocrites _shall_ _be_ desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. ^34

35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. ^35
