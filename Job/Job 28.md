### Job 28

1 SURELY there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold _where_ they fine _it_. ^1

2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass _is_ molten _out_ _of_ the stone. ^2

3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. ^3

4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; _even_ _the_ _waters_ forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. ^4

5 _As_ _for_ the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. ^5

6 The stones of it _are_ the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. ^6

7 _There_ _is_ a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: ^7

8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. ^8

9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. ^9

10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. ^10

11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and _the_ _thing_ _that_ _is_ hid bringeth he forth to light. ^11

12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where _is_ the place of understanding? ^12

13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. ^13

14 The depth saith, It _is_ not in me: and the sea saith, _It_ _is_ not with me. ^14

15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed _for_ the price thereof. ^15

16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. ^16

17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it _shall_ _not_ _be_ _for_ jewels of fine gold. ^17

18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom _is_ above rubies. ^18

19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. ^19

20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where _is_ the place of understanding? ^20

21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. ^21

22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. ^22

23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. ^23

24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, _and_ seeth under the whole heaven; ^24

25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. ^25

26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: ^26

27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. ^27

28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that _is_ wisdom; and to depart from evil _is_ understanding. ^28
