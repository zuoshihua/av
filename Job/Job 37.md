### Job 37

1 AT this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. ^1

2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound _that_ goeth out of his mouth. ^2

3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. ^3

4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. ^4

5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. ^5

6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou _on_ the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. ^6

7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. ^7

8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. ^8

9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. ^9

10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. ^10

11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: ^11

12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. ^12

13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. ^13

14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. ^14

15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? ^15

16 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? ^16

17 How thy garments _are_ warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south _wind?_ ^17

18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, _which_ _is_ strong, _and_ as a molten looking glass? ^18

19 Teach us what we shall say unto him; _for_ we cannot order _our_ _speech_ by reason of darkness. ^19

20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. ^20

21 And now _men_ see not the bright light which _is_ in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. ^21

22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God _is_ terrible majesty. ^22

23 _Touching_ the Almighty, we cannot find him out: _he_ _is_ excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict. ^23

24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any _that_ _are_ wise of heart. ^24
