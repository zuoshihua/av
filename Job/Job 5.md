### Job 5

1 CALL now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? ^1

2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. ^2

3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. ^3

4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither _is_ _there_ any to deliver _them_. ^4

5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. ^5

6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; ^6

7 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. ^7

8 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: ^8

9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: ^9

10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: ^10

11 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. ^11

12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform _their_ enterprise. ^12

13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. ^13

14 They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night. ^14

15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. ^15

16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. ^16

17 Behold, happy _is_ the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: ^17

18 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. ^18

19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. ^19

20 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword. ^20

21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. ^21

22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. ^22

23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. ^23

24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle _shall_ _be_ in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. ^24

25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed _shall_ _be_ great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. ^25

26 Thou shalt come to _thy_ grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. ^26

27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it _is;_ hear it, and know thou _it_ for thy good. ^27
