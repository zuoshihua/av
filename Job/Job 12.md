### Job 12

1 AND Job answered and said, ^1

2 No doubt but ye _are_ the people, and wisdom shall die with you. ^2

3 But I have understanding as well as you; I _am_ not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? ^3

4 I am _as_ one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright _man_ _is_ laughed to scorn. ^4

5 He that is ready to slip with _his_ feet _is_ _as_ a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. ^5

6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth _abundantly_. ^6

7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: ^7

8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. ^8

9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ hath wrought this? ^9

10 In whose hand _is_ the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. ^10

11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? ^11

12 With the ancient _is_ wisdom; and in length of days understanding. ^12

13 With him _is_ wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. ^13

14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. ^14

15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. ^15

16 With him _is_ strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver _are_ his. ^16

17 He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. ^17

18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. ^18

19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. ^19

20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. ^20

21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. ^21

22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. ^22

23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them _again_. ^23

24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness _where_ _there_ _is_ no way. ^24

25 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like _a_ drunken _man_. ^25
