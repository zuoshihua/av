### Job 20

1 THEN answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, ^1

2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for _this_ I make haste. ^2

3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. ^3

4 Knowest thou _not_ this of old, since man was placed upon earth, ^4

5 That the triumphing of the wicked _is_ short, and the joy of the hypocrite _but_ for a moment? ^5

6 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; ^6

7 _Yet_ he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where _is_ he? ^7

8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. ^8

9 The eye also _which_ saw him shall _see_ _him_ no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. ^9

10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. ^10

11 His bones are full _of_ _the_ _sin_ of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. ^11

12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, _though_ he hide it under his tongue; ^12

13 _Though_ he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: ^13

14 _Yet_ his meat in his bowels is turned, _it_ _is_ the gall of asps within him. ^14

15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. ^15

16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. ^16

17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. ^17

18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow _it_ down: according to _his_ substance _shall_ the restitution _be_, and he shall not rejoice _therein_. ^18

19 Because he hath oppressed _and_ hath forsaken the poor; _because_ he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; ^19

20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. ^20

21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. ^21

22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. ^22

23 _When_ he is about to fill his belly, _God_ shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain _it_ upon him while he is eating. ^23

24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, _and_ the bow of steel shall strike him through. ^24

25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors _are_ upon him. ^25

26 All darkness _shall_ _be_ hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. ^26

27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. ^27

28 The increase of his house shall depart, _and_ _his_ _goods_ shall flow away in the day of his wrath. ^28

29 This _is_ the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. ^29
