### Job 26

1 BUT Job answered and said, ^1

2 How hast thou helped _him_ _that_ _is_ without power? _how_ savest thou the arm _that_ _hath_ no strength? ^2

3 How hast thou counselled _him_ _that_ _hath_ no wisdom? and _how_ hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? ^3

4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? ^4

5 Dead _things_ are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. ^5

6 Hell _is_ naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. ^6

7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, _and_ hangeth the earth upon nothing. ^7

8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. ^8

9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, _and_ spreadeth his cloud upon it. ^9

10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. ^10

11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. ^11

12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. ^12

13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. ^13

14 Lo, these _are_ parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? ^14
