### Job 41

1 CANST thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord _which_ thou lettest down? ^1

2 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? ^2

3 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft _words_ unto thee? ^3

4 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? ^4

5 Wilt thou play with him as _with_ a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? ^5

6 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? ^6

7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? ^7

8 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. ^8

9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not _one_ be cast down even at the sight of him? ^9

10 None _is_ _so_ fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? ^10

11 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay _him?_ _whatsoever_ _is_ under the whole heaven is mine. ^11

12 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. ^12

13 Who can discover the face of his garment? _or_ who can come _to_ _him_ with his double bridle? ^13

14 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth _are_ terrible round about. ^14

15 _His_ scales _are_ _his_ pride, shut up together _as_ _with_ a close seal. ^15

16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. ^16

17 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. ^17

18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes _are_ like the eyelids of the morning. ^18

19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, _and_ sparks of fire leap out. ^19

20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as _out_ of a seething pot or caldron. ^20

21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. ^21

22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. ^22

23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. ^23

24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether _millstone_. ^24

25 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. ^25

26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. ^26

27 He esteemeth iron as straw, _and_ brass as rotten wood. ^27

28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. ^28

29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. ^29

30 Sharp stones _are_ under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. ^30

31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. ^31

32 He maketh a path to shine after him; _one_ would think the deep _to_ _be_ hoary. ^32

33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. ^33

34 He beholdeth all high _things:_ he _is_ a king over all the children of pride. ^34
