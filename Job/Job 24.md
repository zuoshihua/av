### Job 24

1 WHY, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? ^1

2 _Some_ remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed _thereof_. ^2

3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. ^3

4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. ^4

5 Behold, _as_ wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness _yieldeth_ food for them _and_ for _their_ children. ^5

6 They reap _every_ _one_ his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. ^6

7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that _they_ _have_ no covering in the cold. ^7

8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. ^8

9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. ^9

10 They cause _him_ to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf _from_ the hungry; ^10

11 _Which_ make oil within their walls, _and_ tread _their_ winepresses, and suffer thirst. ^11

12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly _to_ _them_. ^12

13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. ^13

14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. ^14

15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth _his_ face. ^15

16 In the dark they dig through houses, _which_ they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. ^16

17 For the morning _is_ to them even as the shadow of death: if _one_ know _them_, _they_ _are_ _in_ the terrors of the shadow of death. ^17

18 He _is_ swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. ^18

19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: _so_ _doth_ the grave _those_ _which_ have sinned. ^19

20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. ^20

21 He evil entreateth the barren _that_ beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. ^21

22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no _man_ is sure of life. ^22

23 _Though_ it be given him _to_ _be_ in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes _are_ upon their ways. ^23

24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all _other_, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. ^24

25 And if _it_ _be_ not _so_ now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? ^25
