### Job 25

1 THEN answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, ^1

2 Dominion and fear _are_ with him, he maketh peace in his high places. ^2

3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? ^3

4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean _that_ _is_ born of a woman? ^4

5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. ^5

6 How much less man, _that_ _is_ a worm? and the son of man, _which_ _is_ a worm? ^6
