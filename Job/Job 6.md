### Job 6

1 BUT Job answered and said, ^1

2 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! ^2

3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. ^3

4 For the arrows of the Almighty _are_ within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. ^4

5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? ^5

6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there _any_ taste in the white of an egg? ^6

7 The things _that_ my soul refused to touch _are_ as my sorrowful meat. ^7

8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant _me_ the thing that I long for! ^8

9 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! ^9

10 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. ^10

11 What _is_ my strength, that I should hope? and what _is_ mine end, that I should prolong my life? ^11

12 _Is_ my strength the strength of stones? or _is_ my flesh of brass? ^12

13 _Is_ not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? ^13

14 To him that is afflicted pity _should_ _be_ _shewed_ from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. ^14

15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, _and_ as the stream of brooks they pass away; ^15

16 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, _and_ wherein the snow is hid: ^16

17 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. ^17

18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. ^18

19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. ^19

20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. ^20

21 For now ye are nothing; ye see _my_ casting down, and are afraid. ^21

22 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? ^22

23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? ^23

24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. ^24

25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? ^25

26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, _which_ _are_ as wind? ^26

27 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig _a_ _pit_ for your friend. ^27

28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for _it_ _is_ evident unto you if I lie. ^28

29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness _is_ in it. ^29

30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? ^30
