### Job 8

1 THEN answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, ^1

2 How long wilt thou speak these _things?_ and _how_ _long_ _shall_ the words of thy mouth _be_ _like_ a strong wind? ^2

3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? ^3

4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; ^4

5 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; ^5

6 If thou _wert_ pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. ^6

7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. ^7

8 For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: ^8

9 (For we _are_ _but_ _of_ yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth _are_ a shadow:) ^9

10 Shall not they teach thee, _and_ tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? ^10

11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? ^11

12 Whilst it _is_ yet in his greenness, _and_ not cut down, it withereth before any _other_ herb. ^12

13 So _are_ the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: ^13

14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust _shall_ _be_ a spider's web. ^14

15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. ^15

16 He _is_ green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. ^16

17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, _and_ seeth the place of stones. ^17

18 If he destroy him from his place, then _it_ shall deny him, _saying_, I have not seen thee. ^18

19 Behold, this _is_ the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. ^19

20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect _man_, neither will he help the evil doers: ^20

21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. ^21

22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. ^22
