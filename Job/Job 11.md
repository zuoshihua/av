### Job 11

1 THEN answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, ^1

2 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? ^2

3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? ^3

4 For thou hast said, My doctrine _is_ pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. ^4

5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; ^5

6 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that _they_ _are_ double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee _less_ than thine iniquity _deserveth_. ^6

7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? ^7

8 _It_ _is_ as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? ^8

9 The measure thereof _is_ longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. ^9

10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? ^10

11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider _it?_ ^11

12 For vain man would be wise, though man be born _like_ a wild ass's colt. ^12

13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; ^13

14 If iniquity _be_ in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. ^14

15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: ^15

16 Because thou shalt forget _thy_ misery, _and_ remember _it_ as waters _that_ pass away: ^16

17 And _thine_ age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. ^17

18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig _about_ _thee_, _and_ thou shalt take thy rest in safety. ^18

19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make _thee_ afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. ^19

20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope _shall_ _be_ _as_ the giving up of the ghost. ^20
