### Job 16

1 THEN Job answered and said, ^1

2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters _are_ ye all. ^2

3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? ^3

4 I also could speak as ye _do:_ if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. ^4

5 _But_ I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage _your_ _grief_. ^5

6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and _though_ I forbear, what am I eased? ^6

7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. ^7

8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, _which_ is a witness _against_ _me:_ and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. ^8

9 He teareth _me_ in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. ^9

10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. ^10

11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. ^11

12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken _me_ by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. ^12

13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. ^13

14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. ^14

15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. ^15

16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids _is_ the shadow of death; ^16

17 Not for _any_ injustice in mine hands: also my prayer _is_ pure. ^17

18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. ^18

19 Also now, behold, my witness _is_ in heaven, and my record _is_ on high. ^19

20 My friends scorn me: _but_ mine eye poureth out _tears_ unto God. ^20

21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man _pleadeth_ for his neighbour! ^21

22 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way _whence_ I shall not return. ^22
