### Job 30

1 BUT now _they_ _that_ _are_ younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. ^1

2 Yea, whereto _might_ the strength of their hands _profit_ me, in whom old age was perished? ^2

3 For want and famine _they_ _were_ solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. ^3

4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots _for_ their meat. ^4

5 They were driven forth from among _men_, (they cried after them as _after_ a thief;) ^5

6 To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, _in_ caves of the earth, and _in_ the rocks. ^6

7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. ^7

8 _They_ _were_ children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. ^8

9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. ^9

10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. ^10

11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. ^11

12 Upon _my_ right _hand_ rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. ^12

13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. ^13

14 They came _upon_ _me_ as a wide breaking in _of_ _waters:_ in the desolation they rolled themselves _upon_ _me_. ^14

15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. ^15

16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. ^16

17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. ^17

18 By the great force _of_ _my_ _disease_ is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. ^18

19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. ^19

20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me _not_. ^20

21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. ^21

22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride _upon_ _it_, and dissolvest my substance. ^22

23 For I know _that_ thou wilt bring me _to_ death, and _to_ the house appointed for all living. ^23

24 Howbeit he will not stretch out _his_ hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. ^24

25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was _not_ my soul grieved for the poor? ^25

26 When I looked for good, then evil came _unto_ _me:_ and when I waited for light, there came darkness. ^26

27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me. ^27

28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, _and_ I cried in the congregation. ^28

29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. ^29

30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. ^30

31 My harp also is _turned_ to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep. ^31
