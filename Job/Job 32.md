### Job 32

1 SO these three men ceased to answer Job, because he _was_ righteous in his own eyes. ^1

2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. ^2

3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and _yet_ had condemned Job. ^3

4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they _were_ elder than he. ^4

5 When Elihu saw that _there_ _was_ no answer in the mouth of _these_ three men, then his wrath was kindled. ^5

6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I _am_ young, and ye _are_ very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. ^6

7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. ^7

8 But _there_ _is_ a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. ^8

9 Great men are not _always_ wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. ^9

10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. ^10

11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. ^11

12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, _there_ _was_ none of you that convinced Job, _or_ that answered his words: ^12

13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. ^13

14 Now he hath not directed _his_ words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. ^14

15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. ^15

16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, _and_ answered no more;) ^16

17 _I_ _said_, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. ^17

18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. ^18

19 Behold, my belly _is_ as wine _which_ hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. ^19

20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. ^20

21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. ^21

22 For I know not to give flattering titles; _in_ _so_ _doing_ my maker would soon take me away. ^22
