### Job 36

1 ELIHU also proceeded, and said, ^1

2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that _I_ _have_ yet to speak on God's behalf. ^2

3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. ^3

4 For truly my words _shall_ not _be_ false: he that is perfect in knowledge _is_ with thee. ^4

5 Behold, God _is_ mighty, and despiseth not _any:_ _he_ _is_ mighty in strength _and_ wisdom. ^5

6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. ^6

7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings _are_ _they_ on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. ^7

8 And if _they_ _be_ bound in fetters, _and_ be holden in cords of affliction; ^8

9 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. ^9

10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. ^10

11 If they obey and serve _him_, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. ^11

12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. ^12

13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. ^13

14 They die in youth, and their life _is_ among the unclean. ^14

15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. ^15

16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait _into_ a broad place, where _there_ _is_ no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table _should_ _be_ full of fatness. ^16

17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold _on_ _thee_. ^17

18 Because _there_ _is_ wrath, _beware_ lest he take thee away with _his_ stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. ^18

19 Will he esteem thy riches? _no_, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. ^19

20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. ^20

21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. ^21

22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? ^22

23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? ^23

24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. ^24

25 Every man may see it; man may behold _it_ afar off. ^25

26 Behold, God _is_ great, and we know _him_ not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. ^26

27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: ^27

28 Which the clouds do drop _and_ distil upon man abundantly. ^28

29 Also can _any_ understand the spreadings of the clouds, _or_ the noise of his tabernacle? ^29

30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. ^30

31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. ^31

32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it _not_ _to_ _shine_ by _the_ _cloud_ that cometh betwixt. ^32

33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. ^33
