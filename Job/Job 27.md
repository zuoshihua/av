### Job 27

1 MOREOVER Job continued his parable, and said, ^1

2 _As_ God liveth, _who_ hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, _who_ hath vexed my soul; ^2

3 All the while my breath _is_ in me, and the spirit of God _is_ in my nostrils; ^3

4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. ^4

5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. ^5

6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach _me_ so long as I live. ^6

7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. ^7

8 For what _is_ the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? ^8

9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? ^9

10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? ^10

11 I will teach you by the hand of God: _that_ which _is_ with the Almighty will I not conceal. ^11

12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen _it;_ why then are ye thus altogether vain? ^12

13 This _is_ the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, _which_ they shall receive of the Almighty. ^13

14 If his children be multiplied, _it_ _is_ for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. ^14

15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. ^15

16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; ^16

17 He may prepare _it_, but the just shall put _it_ on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. ^17

18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth _that_ the keeper maketh. ^18

19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he _is_ not. ^19

20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. ^20

21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. ^21

22 For _God_ shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. ^22

23 _Men_ shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. ^23
