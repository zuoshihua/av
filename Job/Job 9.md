### Job 9

1 THEN Job answered and said, ^1

2 I know _it_ _is_ so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? ^2

3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. ^3

4 _He_ _is_ wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened _himself_ against him, and hath prospered? ^4

5 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. ^5

6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. ^6

7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. ^7

8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. ^8

9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. ^9

10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. ^10

11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see _him_ not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. ^11

12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? ^12

13 _If_ God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. ^13

14 How much less shall I answer him, _and_ choose out my words _to_ _reason_ with him? ^14

15 Whom, though I were righteous, _yet_ would I not answer, _but_ I would make supplication to my judge. ^15

16 If I had called, and he had answered me; _yet_ would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. ^16

17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. ^17

18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. ^18

19 If _I_ _speak_ of strength, lo, _he_ _is_ strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time _to_ _plead?_ ^19

20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: _if_ _I_ _say_, I _am_ perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. ^20

21 _Though_ I _were_ perfect, _yet_ would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. ^21

22 This _is_ one _thing_, therefore I said _it_, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. ^22

23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. ^23

24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, _and_ who _is_ he? ^24

25 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. ^25

26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle _that_ hasteth to the prey. ^26

27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort _myself:_ ^27

28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. ^28

29 _If_ I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? ^29

30 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; ^30

31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. ^31

32 For _he_ _is_ not a man, as I _am_, _that_ I should answer him, _and_ we should come together in judgment. ^32

33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, _that_ might lay his hand upon us both. ^33

34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: ^34

35 _Then_ would I speak, and not fear him; but _it_ _is_ not so with me. ^35
