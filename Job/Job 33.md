### Job 33

1 WHEREFORE, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. ^1

2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. ^2

3 My words _shall_ _be_ _of_ the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. ^3

4 The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. ^4

5 If thou canst answer me, set _thy_ _words_ in order before me, stand up. ^5

6 Behold, I _am_ according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. ^6

7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. ^7

8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of _thy_ words, _saying_, ^8

9 I am clean without transgression, I _am_ innocent; neither _is_ _there_ iniquity in me. ^9

10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, ^10

11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. ^11

12 Behold, _in_ this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. ^12

13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. ^13

14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, _yet_ _man_ perceiveth it not. ^14

15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; ^15

16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, ^16

17 That he may withdraw man _from_ _his_ purpose, and hide pride from man. ^17

18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. ^18

19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong _pain:_ ^19

20 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. ^20

21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones _that_ were not seen stick out. ^21

22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. ^22

23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: ^23

24 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. ^24

25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: ^25

26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. ^26

27 He looketh upon men, and _if_ _any_ say, I have sinned, and perverted _that_ _which_ _was_ right, and it profited me not; ^27

28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. ^28

29 Lo, all these _things_ worketh God oftentimes with man, ^29

30 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. ^30

31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. ^31

32 If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. ^32

33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. ^33
