### Job 3

1 AFTER this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. ^1

2 And Job spake, and said, ^2

3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night _in_ _which_ it was said, There is a man child conceived. ^3

4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. ^4

5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. ^5

6 _As_ _for_ that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. ^6

7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. ^7

8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. ^8

9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but _have_ none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: ^9

10 Because it shut not up the doors of my _mother_'_s_ womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. ^10

11 Why died I not from the womb? _why_ did I _not_ give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? ^11

12 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? ^12

13 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, ^13

14 With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; ^14

15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: ^15

16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants _which_ never saw light. ^16

17 There the wicked cease _from_ troubling; and there the weary be at rest. ^17

18 _There_ the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. ^18

19 The small and great are there; and the servant _is_ free from his master. ^19

20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter _in_ soul; ^20

21 Which long for death, but it _cometh_ not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; ^21

22 Which rejoice exceedingly, _and_ are glad, when they can find the grave? ^22

23 _Why_ _is_ _light_ _given_ to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? ^23

24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. ^24

25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. ^25

26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. ^26
