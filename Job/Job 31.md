### Job 31

1 I MADE a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? ^1

2 For what portion of God _is_ _there_ from above? and _what_ inheritance of the Almighty from on high? ^2

3 _Is_ not destruction to the wicked? and a strange _punishment_ to the workers of iniquity? ^3

4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? ^4

5 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; ^5

6 Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. ^6

7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; ^7

8 _Then_ let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. ^8

9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or _if_ I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; ^9

10 _Then_ let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. ^10

11 For this _is_ an heinous crime; yea, it _is_ an iniquity _to_ _be_ _punished_ _by_ the judges. ^11

12 For it _is_ a fire _that_ consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. ^12

13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; ^13

14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? ^14

15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? ^15

16 If I have withheld the poor from _their_ desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; ^16

17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; ^17

18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as _with_ a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) ^18

19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; ^19

20 If his loins have not blessed me, and _if_ he were _not_ warmed with the fleece of my sheep; ^20

21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: ^21

22 _Then_ let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. ^22

23 For destruction _from_ God _was_ a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. ^23

24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, _Thou_ _art_ my confidence; ^24

25 If I rejoiced because my wealth _was_ great, and because mine hand had gotten much; ^25

26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking _in_ brightness; ^26

27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: ^27

28 This also _were_ an iniquity _to_ _be_ _punished_ _by_ the judge: for I should have denied the God _that_ _is_ above. ^28

29 If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: ^29

30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. ^30

31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. ^31

32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: _but_ I opened my doors to the traveller. ^32

33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: ^33

34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, _and_ went not out of the door? ^34

35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire _is_, _that_ the Almighty would answer me, and _that_ mine adversary had written a book. ^35

36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, _and_ bind it _as_ a crown to me. ^36

37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. ^37

38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; ^38

39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: ^39

40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. ^40
