### Job 23

1 THEN Job answered and said, ^1

2 Even to day _is_ my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. ^2

3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! _that_ I might come _even_ to his seat! ^3

4 I would order _my_ cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. ^4

5 I would know the words _which_ he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. ^5

6 Will he plead against me with _his_ great power? No; but he would put _strength_ in me. ^6

7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. ^7

8 Behold, I go forward, but he _is_ not _there;_ and backward, but I cannot perceive him: ^8

9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold _him:_ he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see _him:_ ^9

10 But he knoweth the way that I take: _when_ he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. ^10

11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. ^11

12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary _food_. ^12

13 But he _is_ in one _mind_, and who can turn him? and _what_ his soul desireth, even _that_ he doeth. ^13

14 For he performeth _the_ _thing_ _that_ _is_ appointed for me: and many such _things_ _are_ with him. ^14

15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. ^15

16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: ^16

17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, _neither_ hath he covered the darkness from my face. ^17
