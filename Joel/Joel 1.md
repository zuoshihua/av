### Joel 1

1 THE word of the $L{\small ORD}$ that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. ^1

2 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? ^2

3 Tell ye your children of it, and _let_ your children _tell_ their children, and their children another generation. ^3

4 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. ^4

5 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. ^5

6 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth _are_ the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. ^6

7 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast _it_ away; the branches thereof are made white. ^7

8 ¶ Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. ^8

9 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the $L{\small ORD}$; the priests, the $L{\small ORD}$'s ministers, mourn. ^9

10 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. ^10

11 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. ^11

12 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, _even_ all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men. ^12

13 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. ^13

14 ¶ Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders _and_ all the inhabitants of the land _into_ the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, and cry unto the $L{\small ORD}$, ^14

15 Alas for the day! for the day of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. ^15

16 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, _yea_, joy and gladness from the house of our God? ^16

17 The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. ^17

18 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. ^18

19 O $L{\small ORD}$, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. ^19

20 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. ^20
