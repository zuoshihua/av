### Jeremiah 5

1 RUN ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be _any_ that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it. ^1

2 And though they say, The $L{\small ORD}$ liveth; surely they swear falsely. ^2

3 O $L{\small ORD}$, _are_ not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, _but_ they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return. ^3

4 Therefore I said, Surely these _are_ poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the $L{\small ORD}$, _nor_ the judgment of their God. ^4

5 I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the $L{\small ORD}$, _and_ the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, _and_ burst the bonds. ^5

6 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, _and_ a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, _and_ their backslidings are increased. ^6

7 ¶ How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by _them_ _that_ _are_ no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses. ^7

8 They were _as_ fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife. ^8

9 Shall I not visit for these _things?_ saith the $L{\small ORD}$: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? ^9

10 ¶ Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they _are_ not the $L{\small ORD}$'s. ^10

11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^11

12 They have belied the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, _It_ _is_ not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: ^12

13 And the prophets shall become wind, and the word _is_ not in them: thus shall it be done unto them. ^13

14 Wherefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them. ^14

15 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: it _is_ a mighty nation, it _is_ an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. ^15

16 Their quiver _is_ as an open sepulchre, they _are_ all mighty men. ^16

17 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, _which_ thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword. ^17

18 Nevertheless in those days, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, I will not make a full end with you. ^18

19 ¶ And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the $L{\small ORD}$ our God all these _things_ unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land _that_ _is_ not yours. ^19

20 Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, ^20

21 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not: ^21

22 Fear ye not me? saith the $L{\small ORD}$: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand _for_ the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it? ^22

23 But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. ^23

24 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. ^24

25 ¶ Your iniquities have turned away these _things_, and your sins have withholden good _things_ from you. ^25

26 For among my people are found wicked _men:_ they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. ^26

27 As a cage is full of birds, so _are_ their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. ^27

28 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. ^28

29 Shall I not visit for these _things?_ saith the $L{\small ORD}$: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? ^29

30 ¶ A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; ^30

31 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love _to_ _have_ _it_ so: and what will ye do in the end thereof? ^31
