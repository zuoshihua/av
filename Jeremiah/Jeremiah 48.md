### Jeremiah 48

1 AGAINST Moab thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded _and_ taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed. ^1

2 _There_ _shall_ _be_ no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from _being_ a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee. ^2

3 A voice of crying _shall_ _be_ from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction. ^3

4 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. ^4

5 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. ^5

6 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. ^6

7 ¶ For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity _with_ his priests and his princes together. ^7

8 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken. ^8

9 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein. ^9

10 Cursed _be_ he that doeth the work of the $L{\small ORD}$ deceitfully, and cursed _be_ he that keepeth back his sword from blood. ^10

11 ¶ Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. ^11

12 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles. ^12

13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence. ^13

14 ¶ How say ye, We _are_ mighty and strong men for the war? ^14

15 Moab is spoiled, and gone up _out_ _of_ her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name _is_ the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^15

16 The calamity of Moab _is_ near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast. ^16

17 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, _and_ the beautiful rod! ^17

18 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from _thy_ glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, _and_ he shall destroy thy strong holds. ^18

19 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, _and_ say, What is done? ^19

20 Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled, ^20

21 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath, ^21

22 And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim, ^22

23 And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon, ^23

24 And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. ^24

25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^25

26 ¶ Make ye him drunken: for he magnified _himself_ against the $L{\small ORD}$: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision. ^26

27 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy. ^27

28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove _that_ maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth. ^28

29 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. ^29

30 I know his wrath, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; but _it_ _shall_ not _be_ so; his lies shall not so effect _it_. ^30

31 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; _mine_ _heart_ shall mourn for the men of Kir-heres. ^31

32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach _even_ to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage. ^32

33 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; _their_ shouting _shall_ _be_ no shouting. ^33

34 From the cry of Heshbon _even_ unto Elealeh, _and_ _even_ unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar _even_ unto Horonaim, _as_ an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. ^34

35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. ^35

36 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the riches _that_ he hath gotten are perished. ^36

37 For every head _shall_ _be_ bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands _shall_ _be_ cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. ^37

38 _There_ _shall_ _be_ lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein _is_ no pleasure, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^38

39 They shall howl, _saying_, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him. ^39

40 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab. ^40

41 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. ^41

42 And Moab shall be destroyed from _being_ a people, because he hath magnified _himself_ against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^42

43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, _shall_ _be_ upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^43

44 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, _even_ upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^44

45 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. ^45

46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. ^46

47 ¶ Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. Thus far _is_ the judgment of Moab. ^47
