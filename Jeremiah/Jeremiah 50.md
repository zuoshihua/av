### Jeremiah 50

1 THE word that the $L{\small ORD}$ spake against Babylon _and_ against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. ^1

2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, _and_ conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. ^2

3 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. ^3

4 ¶ In those days, and in that time, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the $L{\small ORD}$ their God. ^4

5 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, _saying_, Come, and let us join ourselves to the $L{\small ORD}$ in a perpetual covenant _that_ shall not be forgotten. ^5

6 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away _on_ the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. ^6

7 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the $L{\small ORD}$, the habitation of justice, even the $L{\small ORD}$, the hope of their fathers. ^7

8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. ^8

9 ¶ For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows _shall_ _be_ as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. ^9

10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; ^11

12 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations _shall_ _be_ a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. ^12

13 Because of the wrath of the $L{\small ORD}$ it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. ^13

14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it _is_ the vengeance of the $L{\small ORD}$: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. ^15

16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. ^16

17 ¶ Israel _is_ a scattered sheep; the lions have driven _him_ away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. ^17

18 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. ^18

19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. ^19

20 In those days, and in that time, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and _there_ _shall_ _be_ none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve. ^20

21 ¶ Go up against the land of Merathaim, _even_ against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. ^21

22 A sound of battle _is_ in the land, and of great destruction. ^22

23 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! ^23

24 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^24

25 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this _is_ the work of the Lord $G{\small OD}$ of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. ^25

26 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. ^26

27 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. ^27

28 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, the vengeance of his temple. ^28

29 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the $L{\small ORD}$, against the Holy One of Israel. ^29

30 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^30

31 Behold, I _am_ against thee, _O_ _thou_ most proud, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$ of hosts: for thy day is come, the time _that_ I will visit thee. ^31

32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. ^32

33 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah _were_ oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. ^33

34 Their Redeemer _is_ strong; the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. ^34

35 ¶ A sword _is_ upon the Chaldeans, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise _men_. ^35

36 A sword _is_ upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword _is_ upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. ^36

37 A sword _is_ upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that _are_ in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword _is_ upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed. ^37

38 A drought _is_ upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it _is_ the land of graven images, and they are mad upon _their_ idols. ^38

39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell _there_, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. ^39

40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour _cities_ thereof, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; _so_ shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. ^40

41 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. ^41

42 They shall hold the bow and the lance: they _are_ cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, _every_ _one_ put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. ^42

43 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, _and_ pangs as of a woman in travail. ^43

44 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who _is_ a chosen _man_, _that_ I may appoint over her? for who _is_ like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who _is_ that shepherd that will stand before me? ^44

45 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the $L{\small ORD}$, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make _their_ habitation desolate with them. ^45

46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations. ^46
