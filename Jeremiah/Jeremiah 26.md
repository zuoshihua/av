### Jeremiah 26

1 IN the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the $L{\small ORD}$, saying, ^1

2 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Stand in the court of the $L{\small ORD}$'s house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the $L{\small ORD}$'s house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word: ^2

3 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. ^3

4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, ^4

5 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending _them_, but ye have not hearkened; ^5

6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. ^6

7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 ¶ Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the $L{\small ORD}$ had commanded _him_ to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die. ^8

9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 ¶ When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the $L{\small ORD}$'s _house_. ^10

11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man _is_ worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears. ^11

12 ¶ Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The $L{\small ORD}$ sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard. ^12

13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ your God; and the $L{\small ORD}$ will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you. ^13

14 As for me, behold, I _am_ in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you. ^14

15 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the $L{\small ORD}$ hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears. ^15

16 ¶ Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man _is_ not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God. ^16

17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying, ^17

18 Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Zion shall be plowed _like_ a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. ^18

19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the $L{\small ORD}$, and besought the $L{\small ORD}$, and the $L{\small ORD}$ repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls. ^19

20 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah: ^20

21 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; ^21

22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, _namely_, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and _certain_ men with him into Egypt. ^22

23 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people. ^23

24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death. ^24
