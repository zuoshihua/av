### Jeremiah 31

1 AT the same time, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. ^1

2 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, The people _which_ _were_ left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; _even_ Israel, when I went to cause him to rest. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath appeared of old unto me, _saying_, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee. ^3

4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry. ^4

5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat _them_ as common things. ^5

6 For there shall be a day, _that_ the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the $L{\small ORD}$ our God. ^6

7 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O $L{\small ORD}$, save thy people, the remnant of Israel. ^7

8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, _and_ with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither. ^8

9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim _is_ my firstborn. ^9

10 ¶ Hear the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, O ye nations, and declare _it_ in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd _doth_ his flock. ^10

11 For the $L{\small ORD}$ hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of _him_ _that_ _was_ stronger than he. ^11

12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the $L{\small ORD}$, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. ^12

13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. ^13

14 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, _and_ bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they _were_ not. ^15

16 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. ^16

17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that thy children shall come again to their own border. ^17

18 ¶ I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself _thus;_ Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed _to_ _the_ _yoke:_ turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou _art_ the $L{\small ORD}$ my God. ^18

19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon _my_ thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. ^19

20 _Is_ Ephraim my dear son? _is_ _he_ a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20

21 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, _even_ the way _which_ thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. ^21

22 ¶ How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man. ^22

23 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The $L{\small ORD}$ bless thee, O habitation of justice, _and_ mountain of holiness. ^23

24 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they _that_ go forth with flocks. ^24

25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. ^25

26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me. ^26

27 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. ^27

28 And it shall come to pass, _that_ like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^28

29 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. ^29

30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. ^30

31 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: ^31

32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day _that_ I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: ^32

33 But this _shall_ _be_ the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. ^33

34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the $L{\small ORD}$: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. ^34

35 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, which giveth the sun for a light by day, _and_ the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ his name: ^35

36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, _then_ the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. ^36

37 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^37

38 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that the city shall be built to the $L{\small ORD}$ from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner. ^38

39 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. ^39

40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, _shall_ _be_ holy unto the $L{\small ORD}$; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever. ^40
