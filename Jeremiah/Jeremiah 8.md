### Jeremiah 8

1 AT that time, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves: ^1

2 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. ^2

3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^3

4 ¶ Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return? ^4

5 Why _then_ is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. ^5

6 I hearkened and heard, _but_ they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle. ^6

7 Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 How do ye say, We _are_ wise, and the law of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he _it;_ the pen of the scribes _is_ in vain. ^8

9 The wise _men_ are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the $L{\small ORD}$; and what wisdom _is_ in them? ^9

10 Therefore will I give their wives unto others, _and_ their fields to them that shall inherit _them:_ for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. ^10

11 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when _there_ _is_ no peace. ^11

12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12

13 ¶ I will surely consume them, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: _there_ _shall_ _be_ no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and _the_ _things_ _that_ I have given them shall pass away from them. ^13

14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the $L{\small ORD}$ our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 We looked for peace, but no good _came;_ _and_ for a time of health, and behold trouble! ^15

16 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein. ^16

17 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which _will_ not _be_ charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 ¶ _When_ I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart _is_ faint in me. ^18

19 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: _Is_ not the $L{\small ORD}$ in Zion? _is_ not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, _and_ with strange vanities? ^19

20 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. ^20

21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me. ^21

22 _Is_ _there_ no balm in Gilead; _is_ _there_ no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? ^22
