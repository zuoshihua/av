### Jeremiah 12

1 RIGHTEOUS _art_ thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of _thy_ judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? _wherefore_ are all they happy that deal very treacherously? ^1

2 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou _art_ near in their mouth, and far from their reins. ^2

3 But thou, O $L{\small ORD}$, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. ^3

4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end. ^4

5 ¶ If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and _if_ in the land of peace, _wherein_ thou trustedst, _they_ _wearied_ _thee_, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? ^5

6 For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee. ^6

7 ¶ I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. ^7

8 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it. ^8

9 Mine heritage _is_ unto me _as_ a speckled bird, the birds round about _are_ against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour. ^9

10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. ^10

11 They have made it desolate, _and_ _being_ desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth _it_ to heart. ^11

12 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall devour from the _one_ end of the land even to the _other_ end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. ^12

13 They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, _but_ shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. ^14

15 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. ^15

16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The $L{\small ORD}$ liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people. ^16

17 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17
