### Jeremiah 6

1 O YE children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction. ^1

2 I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate _woman_. ^2

3 The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch _their_ tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. ^3

4 Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. ^4

5 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces. ^5

6 ¶ For thus hath the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this _is_ the city to be visited; she _is_ wholly oppression in the midst of her. ^6

7 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually _is_ grief and wounds. ^7

8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited. ^8

9 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets. ^9

10 To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear _is_ uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. ^10

11 Therefore I am full of the fury of the $L{\small ORD}$; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with _him_ _that_ _is_ full of days. ^11

12 And their houses shall be turned unto others, _with_ _their_ fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12

13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one _is_ given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. ^13

14 They have healed also the hurt _of_ _the_ _daughter_ of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when _there_ _is_ no peace. ^14

15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time _that_ I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^15

16 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where _is_ the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk _therein_. ^16

17 Also I set watchmen over you, _saying_, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. ^17

18 ¶ Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what _is_ among them. ^18

19 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, _even_ the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it. ^19

20 To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings _are_ not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me. ^20

21 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish. ^21

22 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth. ^22

23 They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they _are_ cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion. ^23

24 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, _and_ pain, as of a woman in travail. ^24

25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy _and_ fear _is_ on every side. ^25

26 ¶ O daughter of my people, gird _thee_ with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, _as_ _for_ an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. ^26

27 I have set thee _for_ a tower _and_ a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way. ^27

28 They _are_ all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: _they_ _are_ brass and iron; they _are_ all corrupters. ^28

29 The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. ^29

30 Reprobate silver shall _men_ call them, because the $L{\small ORD}$ hath rejected them. ^30
