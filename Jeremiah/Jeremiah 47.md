### Jeremiah 47

1 THE word of the $L{\small ORD}$ that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. ^1

2 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl. ^2

3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong _horses_, at the rushing of his chariots, _and_ _at_ the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to _their_ children for feebleness of hands; ^3

4 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, _and_ to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the $L{\small ORD}$ will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor. ^4

5 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off _with_ the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? ^5

6 O thou sword of the $L{\small ORD}$, how long _will_ _it_ _be_ ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still. ^6

7 How can it be quiet, seeing the $L{\small ORD}$ hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it. ^7
