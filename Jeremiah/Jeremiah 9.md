### Jeremiah 9

1 OH that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! ^1

2 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they _be_ all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. ^2

3 And they bend their tongues _like_ their bow _for_ lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^3

4 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders. ^4

5 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, _and_ weary themselves to commit iniquity. ^5

6 Thine habitation _is_ in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people? ^7

8 Their tongue _is_ _as_ an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: _one_ speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait. ^8

9 ¶ Shall I not visit them for these _things?_ saith the $L{\small ORD}$: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? ^9

10 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through _them;_ neither can _men_ hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone. ^10

11 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, _and_ a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant. ^11

12 ¶ Who _is_ the wise man, that may understand this? and _who_ _is_ _he_ to whom the mouth of the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth _and_ is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through? ^12

13 And the $L{\small ORD}$ saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein; ^13

14 But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them: ^14

15 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, _even_ this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. ^15

16 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them. ^16

17 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning _women_, that they may come: ^17

18 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. ^18

19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast _us_ out. ^19

20 Yet hear the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation. ^20

21 For death is come up into our windows, _and_ is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, _and_ the young men from the streets. ^21

22 Speak, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather _them_. ^22

23 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Let not the wise _man_ glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty _man_ glory in his might, let not the rich _man_ glory in his riches: ^23

24 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these _things_ I delight, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^24

25 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that I will punish all _them_ _which_ _are_ circumcised with the uncircumcised; ^25

26 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all _that_ _are_ in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all _these_ nations _are_ uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel _are_ uncircumcised in the heart. ^26
