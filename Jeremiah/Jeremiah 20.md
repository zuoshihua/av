### Jeremiah 20

1 NOW Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who _was_ also chief governor in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things. ^1

2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that _were_ in the high gate of Benjamin, which _was_ by the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^2

3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The $L{\small ORD}$ hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib. ^3

4 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold _it:_ and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. ^4

5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. ^5

6 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. ^6

7 ¶ O $L{\small ORD}$, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. ^7

8 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily. ^8

9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But _his_ _word_ was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not _stay_. ^9

10 ¶ For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, _say_ _they_, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, _saying_, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. ^10

11 But the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: _their_ everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten. ^11

12 But, O $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, that triest the righteous, _and_ seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause. ^12

13 Sing unto the $L{\small ORD}$, praise ye the $L{\small ORD}$: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers. ^13

14 ¶ Cursed _be_ the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed. ^14

15 Cursed _be_ the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad. ^15

16 And let that man be as the cities which the $L{\small ORD}$ overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide; ^16

17 Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb _to_ _be_ always great _with_ _me_. ^17

18 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame? ^18
