### Jeremiah 17

1 THE sin of Judah _is_ written with a pen of iron, _and_ with the point of a diamond: _it_ _is_ graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars; ^1

2 Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills. ^2

3 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance _and_ all thy treasures to the spoil, _and_ thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders. ^3

4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, _which_ shall burn for ever. ^4

5 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Cursed _be_ the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, _in_ a salt land and not inhabited. ^6

7 Blessed _is_ the man that trusteth in the $L{\small ORD}$, and whose hope the $L{\small ORD}$ is. ^7

8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and _that_ spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit. ^8

9 ¶ The heart _is_ deceitful above all _things_, and desperately wicked: who can know it? ^9

10 I the $L{\small ORD}$ search the heart, _I_ try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, _and_ according to the fruit of his doings. ^10

11 _As_ the partridge sitteth _on_ _eggs_, and hatcheth _them_ not; _so_ he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool. ^11

12 ¶ A glorious high throne from the beginning _is_ the place of our sanctuary. ^12

13 O $L{\small ORD}$, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, _and_ they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the $L{\small ORD}$, the fountain of living waters. ^13

14 Heal me, O $L{\small ORD}$, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou _art_ my praise. ^14

15 ¶ Behold, they say unto me, Where _is_ the word of the $L{\small ORD}$? let it come now. ^15

16 As for me, I have not hastened from _being_ a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was _right_ before thee. ^16

17 Be not a terror unto me: thou _art_ my hope in the day of evil. ^17

18 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction. ^18

19 ¶ Thus said the $L{\small ORD}$ unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem; ^19

20 And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates: ^20

21 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring _it_ in by the gates of Jerusalem; ^21

22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. ^22

23 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. ^23

24 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; ^24

25 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. ^25

26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^26

27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched. ^27
