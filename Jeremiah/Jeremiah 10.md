### Jeremiah 10

1 HEAR ye the word which the $L{\small ORD}$ speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: ^1

2 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. ^2

3 For the customs of the people _are_ vain: for _one_ cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. ^3

4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. ^4

5 They _are_ upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also _is_ _it_ in them to do good. ^5

6 Forasmuch as _there_ _is_ none like unto thee, O $L{\small ORD}$; thou _art_ great, and thy name _is_ great in might. ^6

7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise _men_ of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, _there_ _is_ none like unto thee. ^7

8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock _is_ a doctrine of vanities. ^8

9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple _is_ their clothing: they _are_ all the work of cunning _men_. ^9

10 But the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ the true God, he _is_ the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. ^10

11 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, _even_ they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. ^11

12 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. ^12

13 When he uttereth his voice, _there_ _is_ a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. ^13

14 Every man is brutish in _his_ knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image _is_ falsehood, and _there_ _is_ no breath in them. ^14

15 They _are_ vanity, _and_ the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. ^15

16 The portion of Jacob _is_ not like them: for he _is_ the former of all _things;_ and Israel _is_ the rod of his inheritance: The $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts _is_ his name. ^16

17 ¶ Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. ^17

18 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find _it_ _so_. ^18

19 ¶ Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this _is_ a grief, and I must bear it. ^19

20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they _are_ not: _there_ _is_ none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. ^20

21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the $L{\small ORD}$: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered. ^21

22 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, _and_ a den of dragons. ^22

23 ¶ O $L{\small ORD}$, I know that the way of man _is_ not in himself: _it_ _is_ not in man that walketh to direct his steps. ^23

24 O $L{\small ORD}$, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. ^24

25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate. ^25
