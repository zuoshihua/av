### Jeremiah 15

1 THEN said the $L{\small ORD}$ unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, _yet_ my mind _could_ not _be_ toward this people: cast _them_ out of my sight, and let them go forth. ^1

2 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Such as _are_ for death, to death; and such as _are_ for the sword, to the sword; and such as _are_ for the famine, to the famine; and such as _are_ for the captivity, to the captivity. ^2

3 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy. ^3

4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for _that_ which he did in Jerusalem. ^4

5 For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? ^5

6 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting. ^6

7 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave _them_ of children, I will destroy my people, _since_ they return not from their ways. ^7

8 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused _him_ to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city. ^8

9 She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while _it_ _was_ yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 ¶ Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; _yet_ every one of them doth curse me. ^10

11 The $L{\small ORD}$ said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee _well_ in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. ^11

12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? ^12

13 Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and _that_ for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. ^13

14 And I will make _thee_ to pass with thine enemies into a land _which_ thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, _which_ shall burn upon you. ^14

15 ¶ O $L{\small ORD}$, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke. ^15

16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts. ^16

17 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. ^17

18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, _which_ refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, _and_ _as_ waters _that_ fail? ^18

19 ¶ Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, _and_ thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them. ^19

20 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I _am_ with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20

21 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible. ^21
