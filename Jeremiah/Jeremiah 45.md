3 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. ^3

4 Â¶ Thus shalt thou say unto him, The $L{\small ORD}$ saith thus; Behold, _that_ which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. ^4

5 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek _them_ not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest. ^5
