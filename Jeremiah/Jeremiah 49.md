### Jeremiah 49

1 CONCERNING the Ammonites, thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why _then_ doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? ^1

2 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^2

3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, _and_ his priests and his princes together. ^3

4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, _saying_, Who shall come unto me? ^4

5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$ of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth. ^5

6 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^6

7 ¶ Concerning Edom, thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; _Is_ wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? ^7

8 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time _that_ I will visit him. ^8

9 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave _some_ gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough. ^9

10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he _is_ not. ^10

11 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve _them_ alive; and let thy widows trust in me. ^11

12 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Behold, they whose judgment _was_ not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and _art_ thou he _that_ shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink _of_ _it_. ^12

13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. ^13

14 I have heard a rumour from the $L{\small ORD}$, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, _saying_, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. ^14

15 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, _and_ despised among men. ^15

16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, _and_ the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. ^17

18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour _cities_ thereof, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it. ^18

19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who _is_ a chosen _man_, _that_ I may appoint over her? for who _is_ like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who _is_ that shepherd that will stand before me? ^19

20 Therefore hear the counsel of the $L{\small ORD}$, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. ^20

21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. ^21

22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. ^22

23 ¶ Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; _there_ _is_ sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. ^23

24 Damascus is waxed feeble, _and_ turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on _her:_ anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail. ^24

25 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! ^25

26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^26

27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad. ^27

28 ¶ Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. ^28

29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear _is_ on every side. ^29

30 ¶ Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. ^30

31 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, which have neither gates nor bars, _which_ dwell alone. ^31

32 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them _that_ _are_ in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^32

33 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, _and_ a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor _any_ son of man dwell in it. ^33

34 ¶ The word of the $L{\small ORD}$ that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, ^34

35 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. ^35

36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. ^36

37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, _even_ my fierce anger, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them: ^37

38 And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^38

39 ¶ But it shall come to pass in the latter days, _that_ I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^39
