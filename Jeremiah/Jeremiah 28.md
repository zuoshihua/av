### Jeremiah 28

1 AND it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, _and_ in the fifth month, _that_ Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which _was_ of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, ^1

2 Thus speaketh the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. ^2

3 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the $L{\small ORD}$'s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: ^3

4 And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the $L{\small ORD}$: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. ^4

5 ¶ Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, ^5

6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the $L{\small ORD}$ do so: the $L{\small ORD}$ perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the $L{\small ORD}$'s house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. ^6

7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people; ^7

8 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. ^8

9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, _then_ shall the prophet be known, that the $L{\small ORD}$ hath truly sent him. ^9

10 ¶ Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it. ^10

11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. ^11

12 ¶ Then the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto Jeremiah _the_ _prophet_, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, ^12

13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. ^13

14 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also. ^14

15 ¶ Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The $L{\small ORD}$ hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. ^15

16 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. ^17
