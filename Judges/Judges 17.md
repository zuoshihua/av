### Judges 17

1 AND there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name _was_ Micah. ^1

2 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred _shekels_ of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver _is_ with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed _be_ _thou_ of the $L{\small ORD}$, my son. ^2

3 And when he had restored the eleven hundred _shekels_ of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the $L{\small ORD}$ from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. ^3

4 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred _shekels_ of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah. ^4

5 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. ^5

6 In those days _there_ _was_ no king in Israel, _but_ every man did _that_ _which_ _was_ right in his own eyes. ^6

7 Â¶ And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the family of Judah, who _was_ a Levite, and he sojourned there. ^7

8 And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah to sojourn where he could find _a_ _place:_ and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. ^8

9 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I _am_ a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find _a_ _place_. ^9

10 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten _shekels_ of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. ^10

11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. ^11

12 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. ^12

13 Then said Micah, Now know I that the $L{\small ORD}$ will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to _my_ priest. ^13
