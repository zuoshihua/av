### Judges 13

1 AND the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$; and the $L{\small ORD}$ delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. ^1

2 ¶ And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name _was_ Manoah; and his wife _was_ barren, and bare not. ^2

3 And the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou _art_ barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. ^3

4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean _thing:_ ^4

5 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no rasor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. ^5

6 ¶ Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance _was_ like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he _was_, neither told he me his name: ^6

7 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean _thing:_ for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death. ^7

8 ¶ Then Manoah intreated the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. ^8

9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband _was_ not with her. ^9

10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the _other_ day. ^10

11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, _Art_ thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I _am_. ^11

12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and _how_ shall we do unto him? ^12

13 And the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. ^13

14 She may not eat of any _thing_ that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean _thing:_ all that I commanded her let her observe. ^14

15 ¶ And Manoah said unto the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. ^15

16 And the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the $L{\small ORD}$. For Manoah knew not that he _was_ an angel of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^16

17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$, What _is_ thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour? ^17

18 And the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it _is_ secret? ^18

19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered _it_ upon a rock unto the $L{\small ORD}$: and _the_ _angel_ did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on. ^19

20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on _it_, and fell on their faces to the ground. ^20

21 But the angel of the $L{\small ORD}$ did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he _was_ an angel of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21

22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. ^22

23 But his wife said unto him, If the $L{\small ORD}$ were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these _things_, nor would as at this time have told us _such_ _things_ as these. ^23

24 ¶ And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the $L{\small ORD}$ blessed him. ^24

25 And the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol. ^25
