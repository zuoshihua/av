### Daniel 1

1 IN the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. ^1

2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. ^2

3 ¶ And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring _certain_ of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; ^3

4 Children in whom _was_ no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as _had_ ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. ^4

5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. ^5

6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: ^6

7 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel _the_ _name_ of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego. ^7

8 ¶ But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. ^8

9 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. ^9

10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which _are_ of your sort? then shall ye make _me_ endanger my head to the king. ^10

11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, ^11

12 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. ^12

13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. ^13

14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. ^14

15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. ^15

16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. ^16

17 ¶ As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. ^17

18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. ^18

19 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. ^19

20 And in all matters of wisdom _and_ understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians _and_ astrologers that _were_ in all his realm. ^20

21 And Daniel continued _even_ unto the first year of king Cyrus. ^21
