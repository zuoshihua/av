### Daniel 8

1 IN the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, _even_ _unto_ me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. ^1

2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I _was_ at Shushan _in_ the palace, which _is_ in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. ^2

3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had _two_ horns: and the _two_ horns _were_ high; but one _was_ higher than the other, and the higher came up last. ^3

4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither _was_ _there_ _any_ that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great. ^4

5 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat _had_ a notable horn between his eyes. ^5

6 And he came to the ram that had _two_ horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. ^6

7 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. ^7

8 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. ^8

9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant _land_. ^9

10 And it waxed great, _even_ to the host of heaven; and it cast down _some_ of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. ^10

11 Yea, he magnified _himself_ even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily _sacrifice_ was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. ^11

12 And an host was given _him_ against the daily _sacrifice_ by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. ^12

13 ¶ Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain _saint_ which spake, How long _shall_ _be_ the vision _concerning_ the daily _sacrifice_, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? ^13

14 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. ^14

15 ¶ And it came to pass, when I, _even_ I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. ^15

16 And I heard a man's voice between _the_ _banks_ _of_ Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this _man_ to understand the vision. ^16

17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end _shall_ _be_ the vision. ^17

18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. ^18

19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end _shall_ _be_. ^19

20 The ram which thou sawest having _two_ horns _are_ the kings of Media and Persia. ^20

21 And the rough goat _is_ the king of Grecia: and the great horn that _is_ between his eyes _is_ the first king. ^21

22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. ^22

23 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. ^23

24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. ^24

25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify _himself_ in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. ^25

26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told _is_ true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it _shall_ _be_ for many days. ^26

27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick _certain_ days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood _it_. ^27
