### Daniel 12

1 AND at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation _even_ to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. ^1

2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame _and_ everlasting contempt. ^2

3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. ^3

4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, _even_ to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. ^4

5 Â¶ Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. ^5

6 And _one_ said to the man clothed in linen, which _was_ upon the waters of the river, How long _shall_ _it_ _be_ _to_ the end of these wonders? ^6

7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which _was_ upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that _it_ _shall_ _be_ for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these _things_ shall be finished. ^7

8 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what _shall_ _be_ the end of these _things?_ ^8

9 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words _are_ closed up and sealed till the time of the end. ^9

10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand. ^10

11 And from the time _that_ the daily _sacrifice_ shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, _there_ _shall_ _be_ a thousand two hundred and ninety days. ^11

12 Blessed _is_ he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. ^12

13 But go thou thy way till the end _be:_ for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days. ^13
