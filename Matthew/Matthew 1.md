### Matthew 1

1 THE book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. ^1

2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; ^2

3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; ^3

4 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; ^4

5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; ^5

6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her _that_ _had_ _been_ _the_ _wife_ of Urias; ^6

7 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; ^7

8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; ^8

9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; ^9

10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; ^10

11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: ^11

12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; ^12

13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; ^13

14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; ^14

15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; ^15

16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. ^16

17 So all the generations from Abraham to David _are_ fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon _are_ fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ _are_ fourteen generations. ^17

18 Â¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. ^18

19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just _man_, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. ^19

20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. ^20

21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. ^21

22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, ^22

23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. ^23

24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: ^24

25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS. ^25
