### Romans 8

1 _THERE_ _is_ therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. ^1

2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. ^2

3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: ^3

4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. ^4

5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. ^5

6 For to be carnally minded _is_ death; but to be spiritually minded _is_ life and peace. ^6

7 Because the carnal mind _is_ enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. ^7

8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. ^8

9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. ^9

10 And if Christ _be_ in you, the body _is_ dead because of sin; but the Spirit _is_ life because of righteousness. ^10

11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. ^11

12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. ^12

13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. ^13

14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. ^14

15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. ^15

16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: ^16

17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with _him_, that we may be also glorified together. ^17

18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time _are_ not worthy _to_ _be_ _compared_ with the glory which shall be revealed in us. ^18

19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. ^19

20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected _the_ _same_ in hope, ^20

21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. ^21

22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. ^22

23 And not only _they_, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, _to_ _wit_, the redemption of our body. ^23

24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? ^24

25 But if we hope for that we see not, _then_ do we with patience wait for _it_. ^25

26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. ^26

27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what _is_ the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to _the_ _will_ _of_ God. ^27

28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to _his_ purpose. ^28

29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate _to_ _be_ conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. ^29

30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. ^30

31 What shall we then say to these things? If God _be_ for us, who _can_ _be_ against us? ^31

32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? ^32

33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? _It_ _is_ God that justifieth. ^33

34 Who _is_ he that condemneth? _It_ _is_ Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. ^34

35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? _shall_ tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ^35

36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. ^36

37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. ^37

38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, ^38

39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. ^39
