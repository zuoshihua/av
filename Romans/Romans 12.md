### Romans 12

1 I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, _which_ _is_ your reasonable service. ^1

2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what _is_ that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. ^2

3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think _of_ _himself_ more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. ^3

4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: ^4

5 So we, _being_ many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. ^5

6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, _let_ _us_ _prophesy_ according to the proportion of faith; ^6

7 Or ministry, _let_ _us_ _wait_ on _our_ ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; ^7

8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, _let_ _him_ _do_ _it_ with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. ^8

9 _Let_ love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. ^9

10 _Be_ kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; ^10

11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; ^11

12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; ^12

13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. ^13

14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. ^14

15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. ^15

16 _Be_ of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. ^16

17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. ^17

18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. ^18

19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but _rather_ give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance _is_ mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. ^19

20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. ^20

21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. ^21
