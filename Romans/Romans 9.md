### Romans 9

1 I SAY the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, ^1

2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. ^2

3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: ^3

4 Who are Israelites; to whom _pertaineth_ the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service _of_ _God_, and the promises; ^4

5 Whose _are_ the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ _came_, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. ^5

6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they _are_ not all Israel, which are of Israel: ^6

7 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, _are_ _they_ all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. ^7

8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these _are_ not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. ^8

9 For this _is_ the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son. ^9

10 And not only _this;_ but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, _even_ by our father Isaac; ^10

11 (For _the_ _children_ being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) ^11

12 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. ^12

13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. ^13

14 What shall we say then? _Is_ _there_ unrighteousness with God? God forbid. ^14

15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. ^15

16 So then _it_ _is_ not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. ^16

17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. ^17

18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will _have_ _mercy_, and whom he will he hardeneth. ^18

19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? ^19

20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed _it_, Why hast thou made me thus? ^20

21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? ^21

22 _What_ if God, willing to shew _his_ wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: ^22

23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, ^23

24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? ^24

25 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. ^25

26 And it shall come to pass, _that_ in the place where it was said unto them, Ye _are_ not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. ^26

27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: ^27

28 For he will finish the work, and cut _it_ short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. ^28

29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. ^29

30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. ^30

31 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. ^31

32 Wherefore? Because _they_ _sought_ _it_ not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; ^32

33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. ^33
