### Romans 4

1 WHAT shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? ^1

2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath _whereof_ to glory; but not before God. ^2

3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. ^3

4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. ^4

5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. ^5

6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, ^6

7 _Saying_, Blessed _are_ they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. ^7

8 Blessed _is_ the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. ^8

9 _Cometh_ this blessedness then upon the circumcision _only_, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. ^9

10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. ^10

11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which _he_ _had_ _yet_ being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: ^11

12 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which _he_ _had_ being _yet_ uncircumcised. ^12

13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, _was_ not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. ^13

14 For if they which are of the law _be_ heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: ^14

15 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, _there_ _is_ no transgression. ^15

16 Therefore _it_ _is_ of faith, that _it_ _might_ _be_ by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, ^16

17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, _even_ God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. ^17

18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. ^18

19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb: ^19

20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; ^20

21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. ^21

22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. ^22

23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; ^23

24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; ^24

25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. ^25
