### Romans 14

1 HIM that is weak in the faith receive ye, _but_ not to doubtful disputations. ^1

2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. ^2

3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. ^3

4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. ^4

5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day _alike_. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. ^5

6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth _it_ unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard _it_. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. ^6

7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. ^7

8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. ^8

9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. ^9

10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. ^10

11 For it is written, _As_ I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. ^11

12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. ^12

13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in _his_ brother's way. ^13

14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that _there_ _is_ nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him _it_ _is_ unclean. ^14

15 But if thy brother be grieved with _thy_ meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. ^15

16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of: ^16

17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. ^17

18 For he that in these things serveth Christ _is_ acceptable to God, and approved of men. ^18

19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. ^19

20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed _are_ pure; but _it_ _is_ evil for that man who eateth with offence. ^20

21 _It_ _is_ good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor _any_ _thing_ whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. ^21

22 Hast thou faith? have _it_ to thyself before God. Happy _is_ he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. ^22

23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because _he_ _eateth_ not of faith: for whatsoever _is_ not of faith is sin. ^23
