### 2 Timothy 4

1 I CHARGE _thee_ therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; ^1

2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. ^2

3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; ^3

4 And they shall turn away _their_ ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. ^4

5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. ^5

6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. ^6

7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished _my_ course, I have kept the faith: ^7

8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. ^8

9 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: ^9

10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. ^10

11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. ^11

12 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. ^12

13 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring _with_ _thee_, and the books, _but_ especially the parchments. ^13

14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: ^14

15 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. ^15

16 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all _men_ forsook me: _I_ _pray_ _God_ that it may not be laid to their charge. ^16

17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and _that_ all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. ^17

18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve _me_ unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom _be_ glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^18

19 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. ^19

20 Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. ^20

21 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. ^21

22 The Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with thy spirit. Grace _be_ with you. Amen. ^22
