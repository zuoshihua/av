### 2 Timothy 2

1 THOU therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. ^1

2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. ^2

3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. ^3

4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of _this_ life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. ^4

5 And if a man also strive for masteries, _yet_ is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. ^5

6 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. ^6

7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. ^7

8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: ^8

9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, _even_ unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. ^9

10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. ^10

11 _It_ _is_ a faithful saying: For if we be dead with _him_, we shall also live with _him:_ ^11

12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with _him:_ if we deny _him_, he also will deny us: ^12

13 If we believe not, _yet_ he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. ^13

14 Of these things put _them_ in remembrance, charging _them_ before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, _but_ to the subverting of the hearers. ^14

15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. ^15

16 But shun profane _and_ vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. ^16

17 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymen√¶us and Philetus; ^17

18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. ^18

19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. ^19

20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. ^20

21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, _and_ prepared unto every good work. ^21

22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. ^22

23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. ^23

24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all _men_, apt to teach, patient, ^24

25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; ^25

26 And _that_ they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. ^26
