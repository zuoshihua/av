### Hosea 14

1 O ISRAEL, return unto the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. ^1

2 Take with you words, and turn to the $L{\small ORD}$: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive _us_ graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips. ^2

3 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, _Ye_ _are_ our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. ^3

4 Â¶ I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. ^4

5 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. ^5

6 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. ^6

7 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive _as_ the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof _shall_ _be_ as the wine of Lebanon. ^7

8 Ephraim _shall_ _say_, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard _him_, and observed him: I _am_ like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found. ^8

9 Who _is_ wise, and he shall understand these _things?_ prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the $L{\small ORD}$ _are_ right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein. ^9
