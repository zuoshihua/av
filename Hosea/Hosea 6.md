### Hosea 6

1 COME, and let us return unto the $L{\small ORD}$: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. ^1

2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. ^2

3 Then shall we know, _if_ we follow on to know the $L{\small ORD}$: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter _and_ former rain unto the earth. ^3

4 Â¶ O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness _is_ as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away. ^4

5 Therefore have I hewed _them_ by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments _are_ _as_ the light _that_ goeth forth. ^5

6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. ^6

7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. ^7

8 Gilead _is_ a city of them that work iniquity, _and_ _is_ polluted with blood. ^8

9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, _so_ the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness. ^9

10 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there _is_ the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. ^10

11 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people. ^11
