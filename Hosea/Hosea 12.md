### Hosea 12

1 EPHRAIM feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt. ^1

2 The $L{\small ORD}$ hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. ^2

3 ¶ He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God: ^3

4 Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him _in_ Beth-el, and there he spake with us; ^4

5 Even the $L{\small ORD}$ God of hosts; the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ his memorial. ^5

6 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually. ^6

7 ¶ _He_ _is_ a merchant, the balances of deceit _are_ in his hand: he loveth to oppress. ^7

8 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: _in_ all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that _were_ sin. ^8

9 And I _that_ _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. ^9

10 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. ^10

11 _Is_ _there_ iniquity _in_ Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars _are_ as heaps in the furrows of the fields. ^11

12 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept _sheep_. ^12

13 And by a prophet the $L{\small ORD}$ brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. ^13

14 Ephraim provoked _him_ to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him. ^14
