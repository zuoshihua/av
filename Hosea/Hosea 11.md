### Hosea 11

1 WHEN Israel _was_ a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. ^1

2 _As_ they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. ^2

3 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. ^3

4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them. ^4

5 Â¶ He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. ^5

6 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour _them_, because of their own counsels. ^6

7 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt _him_. ^7

8 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? _how_ shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? _how_ shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. ^8

9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I _am_ God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. ^9

10 They shall walk after the $L{\small ORD}$: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west. ^10

11 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^11

12 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints. ^12
