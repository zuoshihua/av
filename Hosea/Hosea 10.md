### Hosea 10

1 ISRAEL _is_ an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images. ^1

2 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images. ^2

3 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the $L{\small ORD}$; what then should a king do to us? ^3

4 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. ^4

5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof _that_ rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. ^5

6 It shall be also carried unto Assyria _for_ a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. ^6

7 _As_ _for_ Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water. ^7

8 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us. ^8

9 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them. ^9

10 _It_ _is_ in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows. ^10

11 And Ephraim _is_ _as_ an heifer _that_ _is_ taught, _and_ loveth to tread out _the_ _corn;_ but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, _and_ Jacob shall break his clods. ^11

12 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for _it_ _is_ time to seek the $L{\small ORD}$, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. ^12

13 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. ^13

14 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon _her_ children. ^14

15 So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off. ^15
