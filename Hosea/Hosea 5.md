### Hosea 5

1 HEAR ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment _is_ toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. ^1

2 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I _have_ _been_ a rebuker of them all. ^2

3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, _and_ Israel is defiled. ^3

4 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms _is_ in the midst of them, and they have not known the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. ^5

6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the $L{\small ORD}$; but they shall not find _him;_ he hath withdrawn himself from them. ^6

7 They have dealt treacherously against the $L{\small ORD}$: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions. ^7

8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, _and_ the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud _at_ Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin. ^8

9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. ^9

10 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: _therefore_ I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. ^10

11 Ephraim _is_ oppressed _and_ broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. ^11

12 Therefore _will_ I _be_ unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. ^12

13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah _saw_ his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. ^13

14 For I _will_ _be_ unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, _even_ I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue _him_. ^14

15 Â¶ I will go _and_ return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early. ^15
