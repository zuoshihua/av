### Hosea 8

1 _SET_ the trumpet to thy mouth. _He_ _shall_ _come_ as an eagle against the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. ^1

2 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee. ^2

3 Israel hath cast off _the_ _thing_ _that_ _is_ good: the enemy shall pursue him. ^3

4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew _it_ not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. ^4

5 Â¶ Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast _thee_ off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long _will_ _it_ _be_ ere they attain to innocency? ^5

6 For from Israel _was_ it also: the workman made it; therefore it _is_ not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. ^6

7 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. ^7

8 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein _is_ no pleasure. ^8

9 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. ^9

10 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. ^10

11 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. ^11

12 I have written to him the great things of my law, _but_ they were counted as a strange thing. ^12

13 They sacrifice flesh _for_ the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat _it;_ _but_ the $L{\small ORD}$ accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. ^13

14 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. ^14
