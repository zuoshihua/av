### Hosea 3

1 THEN said the $L{\small ORD}$ unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of _her_ friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the $L{\small ORD}$ toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. ^1

2 So I bought her to me for fifteen _pieces_ of silver, and _for_ an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: ^2

3 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for _another_ man: so _will_ I also _be_ for thee. ^3

4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and _without_ teraphim: ^4

5 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the $L{\small ORD}$ their God, and David their king; and shall fear the $L{\small ORD}$ and his goodness in the latter days. ^5
