### Hosea 9

1 REJOICE not, O Israel, for joy, as _other_ people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor. ^1

2 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her. ^2

3 They shall not dwell in the $L{\small ORD}$'s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean _things_ in Assyria. ^3

4 They shall not offer wine _offerings_ to the $L{\small ORD}$, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices _shall_ _be_ unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the $L{\small ORD}$? ^5

6 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant _places_ for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns _shall_ _be_ in their tabernacles. ^6

7 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know _it:_ the prophet _is_ a fool, the spiritual man _is_ mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred. ^7

8 The watchman of Ephraim _was_ with my God: _but_ the prophet _is_ a snare of a fowler in all his ways, _and_ hatred in the house of his God. ^8

9 They have deeply corrupted _themselves_, as in the days of Gibeah: _therefore_ he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. ^9

10 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: _but_ they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto _that_ shame; and _their_ abominations were according as they loved. ^10

11 _As_ _for_ Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. ^11

12 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, _that_ _there_ _shall_ not _be_ a man _left:_ yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! ^12

13 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, _is_ planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer. ^13

14 Give them, O $L{\small ORD}$: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. ^14

15 All their wickedness _is_ in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes _are_ revolters. ^15

16 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay _even_ the beloved _fruit_ of their womb. ^16

17 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations. ^17
