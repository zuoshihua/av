### Hosea 7

1 WHEN I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, _and_ the troop of robbers spoileth without. ^1

2 And they consider not in their hearts _that_ I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face. ^2

3 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. ^3

4 They _are_ all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, _who_ ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. ^4

5 In the day of our king the princes have made _him_ sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. ^5

6 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. ^6

7 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: _there_ _is_ none among them that calleth unto me. ^7

8 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. ^8

9 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth _it_ not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. ^9

10 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the $L{\small ORD}$ their God, nor seek him for all this. ^10

11 ¶ Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. ^11

12 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. ^12

13 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. ^13

14 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, _and_ they rebel against me. ^14

15 Though I have bound _and_ strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. ^15

16 They return, _but_ not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this _shall_ _be_ their derision in the land of Egypt. ^16
