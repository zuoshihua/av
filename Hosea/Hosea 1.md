### Hosea 1

1 THE word of the $L{\small ORD}$ that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. ^1

2 The beginning of the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ by Hosea. And the $L{\small ORD}$ said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, _departing_ from the $L{\small ORD}$. ^2

3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. ^3

4 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little _while_, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. ^4

5 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. ^5

6 ¶ And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And _God_ said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. ^6

7 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the $L{\small ORD}$ their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. ^7

8 ¶ Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. ^8

9 Then said _God_, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye _are_ not my people, and I will not be your _God_. ^9

10 ¶ Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, _that_ in the place where it was said unto them, Ye _are_ not my people, _there_ it shall be said unto them, _Ye_ _are_ the sons of the living God. ^10

11 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great _shall_ _be_ the day of Jezreel. ^11
