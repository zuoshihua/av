### Hosea 13

1 WHEN Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died. ^1

2 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, _and_ idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. ^2

3 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff _that_ is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney. ^3

4 Yet I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for _there_ _is_ no saviour beside me. ^4

5 ¶ I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. ^5

6 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. ^6

7 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe _them:_ ^7

8 I will meet them as a bear _that_ _is_ bereaved _of_ _her_ _whelps_, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them. ^8

9 ¶ O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me _is_ thine help. ^9

10 I will be thy king: where _is_ _any_ _other_ that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? ^10

11 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took _him_ away in my wrath. ^11

12 The iniquity of Ephraim _is_ bound up; his sin _is_ hid. ^12

13 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he _is_ an unwise son; for he should not stay long in _the_ _place_ _of_ the breaking forth of children. ^13

14 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes. ^14

15 ¶ Though he be fruitful among _his_ brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the $L{\small ORD}$ shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels. ^15

16 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. ^16
