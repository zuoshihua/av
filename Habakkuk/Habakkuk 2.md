### Habakkuk 2

1 I WILL stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved. ^1

2 And the $L{\small ORD}$ answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make _it_ plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. ^2

3 For the vision _is_ yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry. ^3

4 Behold, his soul _which_ is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith. ^4

5 ¶ Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, _he_ _is_ a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and _is_ as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people: ^5

6 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth _that_ _which_ _is_ not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! ^6

7 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? ^7

8 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and _for_ the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. ^8

9 ¶ Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil! ^9

10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned _against_ thy soul. ^10

11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it. ^11

12 ¶ Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity! ^12

13 Behold, _is_ _it_ not of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity? ^13

14 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$, as the waters cover the sea. ^14

15 ¶ Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to _him_, and makest _him_ drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! ^15

16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the $L{\small ORD}$'s right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing _shall_ _be_ on thy glory. ^16

17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, _which_ made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. ^17

18 ¶ What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? ^18

19 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it _is_ laid over with gold and silver, and _there_ _is_ no breath at all in the midst of it. ^19

20 But the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him. ^20
