### Habakkuk 1

1 THE burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. ^1

2 O $L{\small ORD}$, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! _even_ cry out unto thee _of_ violence, and thou wilt not save! ^2

3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause _me_ to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence _are_ before me: and there are _that_ raise up strife and contention. ^3

4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. ^4

5 ¶ Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for _I_ will work a work in your days, _which_ ye will not believe, though it be told _you_. ^5

6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, _that_ bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces _that_ _are_ not theirs. ^6

7 They _are_ terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. ^7

8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle _that_ hasteth to eat. ^8

9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up _as_ the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. ^9

10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. ^10

11 Then shall _his_ mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, _imputing_ this his power unto his god. ^11

12 ¶ _Art_ thou not from everlasting, O $L{\small ORD}$ my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O $L{\small ORD}$, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. ^12

13 _Thou_ _art_ of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, _and_ holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth _the_ _man_ _that_ _is_ more righteous than he? ^13

14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, _that_ _have_ no ruler over them? ^14

15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. ^15

16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion _is_ fat, and their meat plenteous. ^16

17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations? ^17
