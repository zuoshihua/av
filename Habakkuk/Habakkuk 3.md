### Habakkuk 3

1 A PRAYER of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. ^1

2 O $L{\small ORD}$, I have heard thy speech, _and_ was afraid: O $L{\small ORD}$, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy. ^2

3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. ^3

4 And _his_ brightness was as the light; he had horns _coming_ out of his hand: and there _was_ the hiding of his power. ^4

5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet. ^5

6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways _are_ everlasting. ^6

7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: _and_ the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. ^7

8 Was the $L{\small ORD}$ displeased against the rivers? _was_ thine anger against the rivers? _was_ thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses _and_ thy chariots of salvation? ^8

9 Thy bow was made quite naked, _according_ to the oaths of the tribes, _even_ _thy_ word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. ^9

10 The mountains saw thee, _and_ they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, _and_ lifted up his hands on high. ^10

11 The sun _and_ moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, _and_ at the shining of thy glittering spear. ^11

12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger. ^12

13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, _even_ for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah. ^13

14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing _was_ as to devour the poor secretly. ^14

15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, _through_ the heap of great waters. ^15

16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops. ^16

17 Â¶ Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither _shall_ fruit _be_ in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and _there_ _shall_ _be_ no herd in the stalls: ^17

18 Yet I will rejoice in the $L{\small ORD}$, I will joy in the God of my salvation. ^18

19 The $L{\small ORD}$ God _is_ my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' _feet_, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments. ^19
