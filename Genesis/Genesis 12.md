### Genesis 12

1 NOW the $L{\small ORD}$ had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: ^1

2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: ^2

3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. ^3

4 So Abram departed, as the $L{\small ORD}$ had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram _was_ seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. ^4

5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. ^5

6 ¶ And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite _was_ then in the land. ^6

7 And the $L{\small ORD}$ appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the $L{\small ORD}$, who appeared unto him. ^7

8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, _having_ Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the $L{\small ORD}$, and called upon the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. ^9

10 ¶ And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine _was_ grievous in the land. ^10

11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou _art_ a fair woman to look upon: ^11

12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This _is_ his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. ^12

13 Say, I pray thee, thou _art_ my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. ^13

14 ¶ And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she _was_ very fair. ^14

15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. ^15

16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. ^16

17 And the $L{\small ORD}$ plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. ^17

18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What _is_ this _that_ thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she _was_ thy wife? ^18

19 Why saidst thou, She _is_ my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take _her_, and go thy way. ^19

20 And Pharaoh commanded _his_ men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. ^20
