### Genesis 25

1 THEN again Abraham took a wife, and her name _was_ Keturah. ^1

2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. ^2

3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. ^3

4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these _were_ the children of Keturah. ^4

5 ¶ And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. ^5

6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. ^6

7 And these _are_ the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. ^7

8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full _of_ _years;_ and was gathered to his people. ^8

9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which _is_ before Mamre; ^9

10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. ^10

11 ¶ And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi. ^11

12 ¶ Now these _are_ the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: ^12

13 And these _are_ the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, ^13

14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, ^14

15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: ^15

16 These _are_ the sons of Ishmael, and these _are_ their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. ^16

17 And these _are_ the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. ^17

18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that _is_ before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: _and_ he died in the presence of all his brethren. ^18

19 ¶ And these _are_ the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: ^19

20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. ^20

21 And Isaac intreated the $L{\small ORD}$ for his wife, because she _was_ barren: and the $L{\small ORD}$ was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. ^21

22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If _it_ _be_ so, why _am_ I thus? And she went to inquire of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^22

23 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto her, Two nations _are_ in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and _the_ _one_ people shall be stronger than _the_ _other_ people; and the elder shall serve the younger. ^23

24 ¶ And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, _there_ _were_ twins in her womb. ^24

25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. ^25

26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac _was_ threescore years old when she bare them. ^26

27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob _was_ a plain man, dwelling in tents. ^27

28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of _his_ venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. ^28

29 ¶ And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he _was_ faint: ^29

30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red _pottage;_ for I _am_ faint: therefore was his name called Edom. ^30

31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. ^31

32 And Esau said, Behold, I _am_ at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? ^32

33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. ^33

34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised _his_ birthright. ^34
