### Genesis 35

1 AND God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. ^1

2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that _were_ with him, Put away the strange gods that _are_ among you, and be clean, and change your garments: ^2

3 And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. ^3

4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which _were_ in their hand, and _all_ _their_ earrings which _were_ in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which _was_ by Shechem. ^4

5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that _were_ round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. ^5

6 ¶ So Jacob came to Luz, which _is_ in the land of Canaan, that _is_, Beth-el, he and all the people that _were_ with him. ^6

7 And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. ^7

8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth. ^8

9 ¶ And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him. ^9

10 And God said unto him, Thy name _is_ Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. ^10

11 And God said unto him, I _am_ God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; ^11

12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. ^12

13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. ^13

14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, _even_ a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. ^14

15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el. ^15

16 ¶ And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. ^16

17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. ^17

18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin. ^18

19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which _is_ Beth-lehem. ^19

20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that _is_ the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. ^20

21 ¶ And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. ^21

22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard _it_. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: ^22

23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: ^23

24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: ^24

25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: ^25

26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these _are_ the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram. ^26

27 ¶ And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which _is_ Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. ^27

28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. ^28

29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, _being_ old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. ^29
