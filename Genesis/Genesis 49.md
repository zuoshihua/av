### Genesis 49

1 AND Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you _that_ which shall befall you in the last days. ^1

2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. ^2

3 ¶ Reuben, thou _art_ my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: ^3

4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou _it:_ he went up to my couch. ^4

5 ¶ Simeon and Levi _are_ brethren; instruments of cruelty _are_ _in_ their habitations. ^5

6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. ^6

7 Cursed _be_ their anger, for _it_ _was_ fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. ^7

8 ¶ Judah, thou _art_ _he_ whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand _shall_ _be_ in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. ^8

9 Judah _is_ a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? ^9

10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him _shall_ the gathering of the people _be_. ^10

11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: ^11

12 His eyes _shall_ _be_ red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. ^12

13 ¶ Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he _shall_ _be_ for an haven of ships; and his border _shall_ _be_ unto Zidon. ^13

14 ¶ Issachar _is_ a strong ass couching down between two burdens: ^14

15 And he saw that rest _was_ good, and the land that _it_ _was_ pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. ^15

16 ¶ Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. ^16

17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. ^17

18 I have waited for thy salvation, O $L{\small ORD}$. ^18

19 ¶ Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last. ^19

20 ¶ Out of Asher his bread _shall_ _be_ fat, and he shall yield royal dainties. ^20

21 ¶ Naphtali _is_ a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words. ^21

22 ¶ Joseph _is_ a fruitful bough, _even_ a fruitful bough by a well; _whose_ branches run over the wall: ^22

23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot _at_ _him_, and hated him: ^23

24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty _God_ of Jacob; (from thence _is_ the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) ^24

25 _Even_ by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: ^25

26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. ^26

27 ¶ Benjamin shall ravin _as_ a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil. ^27

28 ¶ All these _are_ the twelve tribes of Israel: and this _is_ _it_ that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them. ^28

29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that _is_ in the field of Ephron the Hittite, ^29

30 In the cave that _is_ in the field of Machpelah, which _is_ before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace. ^30

31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. ^31

32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that _is_ therein _was_ from the children of Heth. ^32

33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people. ^33
