### Genesis 13

1 AND Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. ^1

2 And Abram _was_ very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. ^2

3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai; ^3

4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 ¶ And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. ^5

6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. ^6

7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. ^7

8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we _be_ brethren. ^8

9 _Is_ not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if _thou_ _wilt_ _take_ the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if _thou_ _depart_ to the right hand, then I will go to the left. ^9

10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it _was_ well watered every where, before the $L{\small ORD}$ destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, _even_ as the garden of the $L{\small ORD}$, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. ^10

11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. ^11

12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched _his_ tent toward Sodom. ^12

13 But the men of Sodom _were_ wicked and sinners before the $L{\small ORD}$ exceedingly. ^13

14 ¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: ^14

15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. ^15

16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, _then_ shall thy seed also be numbered. ^16

17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. ^17

18 Then Abram removed _his_ tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which _is_ in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^18
