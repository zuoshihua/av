### Genesis 21

1 AND the $L{\small ORD}$ visited Sarah as he had said, and the $L{\small ORD}$ did unto Sarah as he had spoken. ^1

2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. ^2

3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. ^3

4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. ^4

5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. ^5

6 ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, _so_ _that_ all that hear will laugh with me. ^6

7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born _him_ a son in his old age. ^7

8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the _same_ day that Isaac was weaned. ^8

9 ¶ And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. ^9

10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, _even_ with Isaac. ^10

11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. ^11

12 ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. ^12

13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he _is_ thy seed. ^13

14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave _it_ unto Hagar, putting _it_ on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. ^14

15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. ^15

16 And she went, and sat her down over against _him_ a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against _him_, and lift up her voice, and wept. ^16

17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he _is_. ^17

18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. ^18

19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. ^19

20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. ^20

21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. ^21

22 ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God _is_ with thee in all that thou doest: ^22

23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: _but_ according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. ^23

24 And Abraham said, I will swear. ^24

25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. ^25

26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I _of_ _it_, but to day. ^26

27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. ^27

28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. ^28

29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What _mean_ these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? ^29

30 And he said, For _these_ seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. ^30

31 Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them. ^31

32 Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. ^32

33 ¶ And _Abraham_ planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the $L{\small ORD}$, the everlasting God. ^33

34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days. ^34
