### Genesis 3

1 NOW the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the $L{\small ORD}$ God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? ^1

2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: ^2

3 But of the fruit of the tree which _is_ in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. ^3

4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: ^4

5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. ^5

6 And when the woman saw that the tree _was_ good for food, and that it _was_ pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make _one_ wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. ^6

7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they _were_ naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. ^7

8 And they heard the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the $L{\small ORD}$ God amongst the trees of the garden. ^8

9 And the $L{\small ORD}$ God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where _art_ thou? ^9

10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I _was_ naked; and I hid myself. ^10

11 And he said, Who told thee that thou _wast_ naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? ^11

12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest _to_ _be_ with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. ^12

13 And the $L{\small ORD}$ God said unto the woman, What _is_ this _that_ thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. ^13

14 And the $L{\small ORD}$ God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou _art_ cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: ^14

15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. ^15

16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire _shall_ _be_ to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. ^16

17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed _is_ the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat _of_ it all the days of thy life; ^17

18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; ^18

19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou _art_, and unto dust shalt thou return. ^19

20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. ^20

21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the $L{\small ORD}$ God make coats of skins, and clothed them. ^21

22 Â¶ And the $L{\small ORD}$ God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: ^22

23 Therefore the $L{\small ORD}$ God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. ^23

24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. ^24
