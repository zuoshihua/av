### Genesis 41

1 AND it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. ^1

2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. ^2

3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the _other_ kine upon the brink of the river. ^3

4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. ^4

5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. ^5

6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. ^6

7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, _it_ _was_ a dream. ^7

8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but _there_ _was_ none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. ^8

9 ¶ Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: ^9

10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, _both_ me and the chief baker: ^10

11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. ^11

12 And _there_ _was_ there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. ^12

13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. ^13

14 ¶ Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved _himself_, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. ^14

15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and _there_ _is_ none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, _that_ thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. ^15

16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, _It_ _is_ not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. ^16

17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: ^17

18 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: ^18

19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: ^19

20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: ^20

21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they _were_ still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. ^21

22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: ^22

23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, _and_ blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: ^23

24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told _this_ unto the magicians; but _there_ _was_ none that could declare _it_ to me. ^24

25 ¶ And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh _is_ one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he _is_ about to do. ^25

26 The seven good kine _are_ seven years; and the seven good ears _are_ seven years: the dream _is_ one. ^26

27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them _are_ seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. ^27

28 This _is_ the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God _is_ about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. ^28

29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: ^29

30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; ^30

31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it _shall_ _be_ very grievous. ^31

32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; _it_ _is_ because the thing _is_ established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. ^32

33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. ^33

34 Let Pharaoh do _this_, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. ^34

35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. ^35

36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. ^36

37 ¶ And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. ^37

38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find _such_ _a_ _one_ as this _is_, a man in whom the Spirit of God _is?_ ^38

39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, _there_ _is_ none so discreet and wise as thou _art:_ ^39

40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. ^40

41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. ^41

42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; ^42

43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him _ruler_ over all the land of Egypt. ^43

44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I _am_ Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. ^44

45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over _all_ the land of Egypt. ^45

46 ¶ And Joseph _was_ thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. ^46

47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. ^47

48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which _was_ round about every city, laid he up in the same. ^48

49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for _it_ _was_ without number. ^49

50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him. ^50

51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, _said_ _he_, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. ^51

52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. ^52

53 ¶ And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. ^53

54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. ^54

55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. ^55

56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. ^56

57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy _corn;_ because that the famine was _so_ sore in all lands. ^57
