### Genesis 39

1 AND Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. ^1

2 And the $L{\small ORD}$ was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. ^2

3 And his master saw that the $L{\small ORD}$ _was_ with him, and that the $L{\small ORD}$ made all that he did to prosper in his hand. ^3

4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all _that_ he had he put into his hand. ^4

5 And it came to pass from the time _that_ he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the $L{\small ORD}$ blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the $L{\small ORD}$ was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. ^5

6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was _a_ goodly _person_, and well favoured. ^6

7 ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. ^7

8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what _is_ with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; ^8

9 _There_ _is_ none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou _art_ his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? ^9

10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, _or_ to be with her. ^10

11 And it came to pass about this time, that _Joseph_ went into the house to do his business; and _there_ _was_ none of the men of the house there within. ^11

12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. ^12

13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, ^13

14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: ^14

15 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. ^15

16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. ^16

17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: ^17

18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. ^18

19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. ^19

20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners _were_ bound: and he was there in the prison. ^20

21 ¶ But the $L{\small ORD}$ was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. ^21

22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that _were_ in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer _of_ _it_. ^22

23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing _that_ _was_ under his hand; because the $L{\small ORD}$ was with him, and _that_ which he did, the $L{\small ORD}$ made _it_ to prosper. ^23
