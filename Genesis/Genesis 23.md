### Genesis 23

1 AND Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: _these_ _were_ the years of the life of Sarah. ^1

2 And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same _is_ Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. ^2

3 ¶ And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, ^3

4 I _am_ a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. ^4

5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, ^5

6 Hear us, my lord: thou _art_ a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. ^6

7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, _even_ to the children of Heth. ^7

8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, ^8

9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which _is_ in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. ^9

10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, _even_ of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, ^10

11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that _is_ therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. ^11

12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. ^12

13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou _wilt_ _give_ _it_, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take _it_ of me, and I will bury my dead there. ^13

14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, ^14

15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land _is_ _worth_ four hundred shekels of silver; what _is_ that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. ^15

16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current _money_ with the merchant. ^16

17 ¶ And the field of Ephron, which _was_ in Machpelah, which _was_ before Mamre, the field, and the cave which _was_ therein, and all the trees that _were_ in the field, that _were_ in all the borders round about, were made sure ^17

18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. ^18

19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same _is_ Hebron in the land of Canaan. ^19

20 And the field, and the cave that _is_ therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth. ^20
