### Genesis 20

1 AND Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. ^1

2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She _is_ my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. ^2

3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou _art_ _but_ a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she _is_ a man's wife. ^3

4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? ^4

5 Said he not unto me, She _is_ my sister? and she, even she herself said, He _is_ my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. ^5

6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. ^6

7 Now therefore restore the man _his_ wife; for he _is_ a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore _her_ not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that _are_ thine. ^7

8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. ^8

9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. ^9

10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? ^10

11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God _is_ not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. ^11

12 And yet indeed _she_ _is_ my sister; she _is_ the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. ^12

13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This _is_ thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He _is_ my brother. ^13

14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave _them_ unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. ^14

15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land _is_ before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. ^15

16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand _pieces_ of silver: behold, he _is_ to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that _are_ with thee, and with all _other:_ thus she was reproved. ^16

17 Â¶ So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare _children_. ^17

18 For the $L{\small ORD}$ had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. ^18
