### Genesis 43

1 AND the famine _was_ sore in the land. ^1

2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. ^2

3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother _be_ with you. ^3

4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: ^4

5 But if thou wilt not send _him_, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother _be_ with you. ^5

6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye _so_ ill with me, _as_ to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? ^6

7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, _Is_ your father yet alive? have ye _another_ brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? ^7

8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, _and_ also our little ones. ^8

9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: ^9

10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. ^10

11 And their father Israel said unto them, If _it_ _must_ _be_ so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: ^11

12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry _it_ again in your hand; peradventure it _was_ an oversight: ^12

13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: ^13

14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved _of_ _my_ _children_, I am bereaved. ^14

15 ¶ And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. ^15

16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring _these_ men home, and slay, and make ready; for _these_ men shall dine with me at noon. ^16

17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. ^17

18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. ^18

19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, ^19

20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: ^20

21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, _every_ man's money _was_ in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. ^21

22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. ^22

23 And he said, Peace _be_ to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. ^23

24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave _them_ water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. ^24

25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. ^25

26 ¶ And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which _was_ in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. ^26

27 And he asked them of _their_ welfare, and said, _Is_ your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? _Is_ he yet alive? ^27

28 And they answered, Thy servant our father _is_ in good health, he _is_ yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. ^28

29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, _Is_ this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. ^29

30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought _where_ to weep; and he entered into _his_ chamber, and wept there. ^30

31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. ^31

32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that _is_ an abomination unto the Egyptians. ^32

33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. ^33

34 And he took _and_ _sent_ messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him. ^34
