### Genesis 46

1 AND Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. ^1

2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here _am_ I. ^2

3 And he said, I _am_ God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: ^3

4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up _again:_ and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. ^4

5 And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. ^5

6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: ^6

7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. ^7

8 ¶ And these _are_ the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. ^8

9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. ^9

10 ¶ And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. ^10

11 ¶ And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. ^11

12 ¶ And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. ^12

13 ¶ And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. ^13

14 ¶ And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. ^14

15 These _be_ the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters _were_ thirty and three. ^15

16 ¶ And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. ^16

17 ¶ And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. ^17

18 These _are_ the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, _even_ sixteen souls. ^18

19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. ^19

20 ¶ And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him. ^20

21 ¶ And the sons of Benjamin _were_ Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. ^21

22 These _are_ the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls _were_ fourteen. ^22

23 ¶ And the sons of Dan; Hushim. ^23

24 ¶ And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. ^24

25 These _are_ the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls _were_ seven. ^25

26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls _were_ threescore and six; ^26

27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, _were_ two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, _were_ threescore and ten. ^27

28 ¶ And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. ^28

29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. ^29

30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou _art_ yet alive. ^30

31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which _were_ in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; ^31

32 And the men _are_ shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. ^32

33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What _is_ your occupation? ^33

34 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, _and_ also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd _is_ an abomination unto the Egyptians. ^34
