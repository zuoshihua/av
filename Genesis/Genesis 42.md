### Genesis 42

1 NOW when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? ^1

2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. ^2

3 ¶ And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. ^3

4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. ^4

5 And the sons of Israel came to buy _corn_ among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. ^5

6 And Joseph _was_ the governor over the land, _and_ he _it_ _was_ that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him _with_ their faces to the earth. ^6

7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. ^7

8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. ^8

9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye _are_ spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. ^9

10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. ^10

11 We _are_ all one man's sons; we _are_ true _men_, thy servants are no spies. ^11

12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. ^12

13 And they said, Thy servants _are_ twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest _is_ this day with our father, and one _is_ not. ^13

14 And Joseph said unto them, That _is_ _it_ that I spake unto you, saying, Ye _are_ spies: ^14

15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. ^15

16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether _there_ _be_ _any_ truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye _are_ spies. ^16

17 And he put them all together into ward three days. ^17

18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; _for_ I fear God: ^18

19 If ye _be_ true _men_, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: ^19

20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. ^20

21 ¶ And they said one to another, We _are_ verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. ^21

22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. ^22

23 And they knew not that Joseph understood _them;_ for he spake unto them by an interpreter. ^23

24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. ^24

25 ¶ Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. ^25

26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. ^26

27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it _was_ in his sack's mouth. ^27

28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, _it_ _is_ even in my sack: and their heart failed _them_, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What _is_ this _that_ God hath done unto us? ^28

29 ¶ And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, ^29

30 The man, _who_ _is_ the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. ^30

31 And we said unto him, We _are_ true _men;_ we are no spies: ^31

32 We _be_ twelve brethren, sons of our father; one _is_ not, and the youngest _is_ this day with our father in the land of Canaan. ^32

33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye _are_ true _men;_ leave one of your brethren _here_ with me, and take _food_ _for_ the famine of your households, and be gone: ^33

34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye _are_ no spies, but _that_ ye _are_ true _men:_ _so_ will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. ^34

35 ¶ And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money _was_ in his sack: and when _both_ they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. ^35

36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved _of_ _my_ _children:_ Joseph _is_ not, and Simeon _is_ not, and ye will take Benjamin _away:_ all these things are against me. ^36

37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. ^37

38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. ^38
