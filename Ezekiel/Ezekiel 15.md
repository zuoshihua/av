### Ezekiel 15

1 AND the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^1

2 Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, _or_ _than_ a branch which is among the trees of the forest? ^2

3 Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will _men_ take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? ^3

4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for _any_ work? ^4

5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for _any_ work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? ^5

6 Â¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. ^6

7 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from _one_ fire, and _another_ fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, when I set my face against them. ^7

8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^8
