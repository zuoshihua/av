### Ezekiel 46

1 THUS saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened. ^1

2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of _that_ gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. ^2

3 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the $L{\small ORD}$ in the sabbaths and in the new moons. ^3

4 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the $L{\small ORD}$ in the sabbath day _shall_ _be_ six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. ^4

5 And the meat offering _shall_ _be_ an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. ^5

6 And in the day of the new moon _it_ _shall_ _be_ a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish. ^6

7 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah. ^7

8 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of _that_ gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. ^8

9 ¶ But when the people of the land shall come before the $L{\small ORD}$ in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it. ^9

10 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth. ^10

11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. ^11

12 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the $L{\small ORD}$, _one_ shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth _one_ shall shut the gate. ^12

13 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$ _of_ a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning. ^13

14 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning _for_ a continual burnt offering. ^15

16 ¶ Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it _shall_ _be_ their possession by inheritance. ^16

17 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them. ^17

18 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; _but_ he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession. ^18

19 ¶ After he brought me through the entry, which _was_ at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there _was_ a place on the two sides westward. ^19

20 Then said he unto me, This _is_ the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear _them_ not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. ^20

21 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court _there_ _was_ a court. ^21

22 In the four corners of the court _there_ _were_ courts joined of forty _cubits_ long and thirty broad: these four corners _were_ of one measure. ^22

23 And _there_ _was_ a row _of_ _building_ round about in them, round about them four, and _it_ _was_ made with boiling places under the rows round about. ^23

24 Then said he unto me, These _are_ the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. ^24
