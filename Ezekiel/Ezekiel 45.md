### Ezekiel 45

1 MOREOVER, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the $L{\small ORD}$, an holy portion of the land: the length _shall_ _be_ the length of five and twenty thousand _reeds_, and the breadth _shall_ _be_ ten thousand. This _shall_ _be_ holy in all the borders thereof round about. ^1

2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred _in_ _length_, with five hundred _in_ _breadth_, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof. ^2

3 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary _and_ the most holy _place_. ^3

4 The holy _portion_ of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the $L{\small ORD}$: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary. ^4

5 And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers. ^5

6 ¶ And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy _portion:_ it shall be for the whole house of Israel. ^6

7 ¶ And _a_ _portion_ _shall_ _be_ for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy _portion_, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy _portion_, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length _shall_ _be_ over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. ^7

8 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and _the_ _rest_ _of_ the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes. ^8

9 ¶ Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^9

10 Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. ^10

11 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. ^11

12 And the shekel _shall_ _be_ twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. ^12

13 This _is_ the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley: ^13

14 Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, _ye_ _shall_ _offer_ the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, _which_ _is_ an homer of ten baths; for ten baths _are_ an homer: ^14

15 And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^15

16 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel. ^16

17 And it shall be the prince's part _to_ _give_ burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel. ^17

18 Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; In the first _month_, in the first _day_ of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary: ^18

19 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put _it_ upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. ^19

20 And so thou shalt do the seventh _day_ of the month for every one that erreth, and for _him_ _that_ _is_ simple: so shall ye reconcile the house. ^20

21 In the first _month_, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. ^21

22 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock _for_ a sin offering. ^22

23 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the $L{\small ORD}$, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily _for_ a sin offering. ^23

24 And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah. ^24

25 In the seventh _month_, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil. ^25
