### Ezekiel 42

1 THEN he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that _was_ over against the separate place, and which _was_ before the building toward the north. ^1

2 Before the length of an hundred cubits _was_ the north door, and the breadth _was_ fifty cubits. ^2

3 Over against the twenty _cubits_ which _were_ for the inner court, and over against the pavement which _was_ for the utter court, _was_ gallery against gallery in three _stories_. ^3

4 And before the chambers _was_ a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. ^4

5 Now the upper chambers _were_ shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. ^5

6 For they _were_ in three _stories_, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore _the_ _building_ was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. ^6

7 And the wall that _was_ without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof _was_ fifty cubits. ^7

8 For the length of the chambers that _were_ in the utter court _was_ fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple _were_ an hundred cubits. ^8

9 And from under these chambers _was_ the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. ^9

10 The chambers _were_ in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. ^10

11 And the way before them _was_ like the appearance of the chambers which _were_ toward the north, as long as they, _and_ as broad as they: and all their goings out _were_ both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. ^11

12 And according to the doors of the chambers that _were_ toward the south _was_ a door in the head of the way, _even_ the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. ^12

13 ¶ Then said he unto me, The north chambers _and_ the south chambers, which _are_ before the separate place, they _be_ holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the $L{\small ORD}$ shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place _is_ holy. ^13

14 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy _place_ into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they _are_ holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to _those_ _things_ which _are_ for the people. ^14

15 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect _is_ toward the east, and measured it round about. ^15

16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. ^16

17 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. ^17

18 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. ^18

19 ¶ He turned about to the west side, _and_ measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. ^19

20 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred _reeds_ long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place. ^20
