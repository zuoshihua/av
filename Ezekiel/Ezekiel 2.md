### Ezekiel 2

1 AND he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. ^1

2 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. ^2

3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, _even_ unto this very day. ^3

4 For _they_ _are_ impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^4

5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they _are_ a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. ^5

6 ¶ And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns _be_ with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they _be_ a rebellious house. ^6

7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they _are_ most rebellious. ^7

8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. ^8

9 ¶ And when I looked, behold, an hand _was_ sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book _was_ therein; ^9

10 And he spread it before me; and it _was_ written within and without: and _there_ _was_ written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe. ^10
