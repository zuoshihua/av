### Ezekiel 43

1 AFTERWARD he brought me to the gate, _even_ the gate that looketh toward the east: ^1

2 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice _was_ like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. ^2

3 And _it_ _was_ according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, _even_ according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions _were_ like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. ^3

4 And the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect _is_ toward the east. ^4

5 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ filled the house. ^5

6 And I heard _him_ speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me. ^6

7 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, _neither_ they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places. ^7

8 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. ^8

9 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. ^9

10 ¶ Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern. ^10

11 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write _it_ in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. ^11

12 This _is_ the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about _shall_ _be_ most holy. Behold, this _is_ the law of the house. ^12

13 ¶ And these _are_ the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit _is_ a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom _shall_ _be_ a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about _shall_ _be_ a span: and this _shall_ _be_ the higher place of the altar. ^13

14 And from the bottom _upon_ the ground _even_ to the lower settle _shall_ _be_ two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle _even_ to the greater settle _shall_ _be_ four cubits, and the breadth _one_ cubit. ^14

15 So the altar _shall_ _be_ four cubits; and from the altar and upward _shall_ _be_ four horns. ^15

16 And the altar _shall_ _be_ twelve _cubits_ long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof. ^16

17 And the settle _shall_ _be_ fourteen _cubits_ long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it _shall_ _be_ half a cubit; and the bottom thereof _shall_ _be_ a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east. ^17

18 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; These _are_ the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon. ^18

19 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$, a young bullock for a sin offering. ^19

20 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put _it_ on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. ^20

21 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. ^21

22 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse _it_ with the bullock. ^22

23 When thou hast made an end of cleansing _it_, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. ^23

24 And thou shalt offer them before the $L{\small ORD}$, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up _for_ a burnt offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$. ^24

25 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat _for_ a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. ^25

26 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves. ^26

27 And when these days are expired, it shall be, _that_ upon the eighth day, and _so_ forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^27
