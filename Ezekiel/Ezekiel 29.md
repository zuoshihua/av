### Ezekiel 29

1 IN the tenth year, in the tenth _month_, in the twelfth _day_ of the month, the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^1

2 Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt: ^2

3 Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Behold, I _am_ against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river _is_ mine own, and I have made _it_ for myself. ^3

4 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales. ^4

5 And I will leave thee _thrown_ into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. ^5

6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. ^6

7 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand. ^7

8 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee. ^8

9 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$: because he hath said, The river _is_ mine, and I have made _it_. ^9

10 Behold, therefore I _am_ against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste _and_ desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia. ^10

11 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. ^11

12 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries _that_ _are_ desolate, and her cities among the cities _that_ _are_ laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. ^12

13 ¶ Yet thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered: ^13

14 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return _into_ the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom. ^14

15 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. ^15

16 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth _their_ iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I _am_ the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^16

17 ¶ And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first _month_, in the first _day_ of the month, the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^17

18 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head _was_ made bald, and every shoulder _was_ peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: ^18

19 Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. ^19

20 I have given him the land of Egypt _for_ his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^20

21 ¶ In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21
