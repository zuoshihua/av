### Ezekiel 41

1 AFTERWARD he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, _which_ _was_ the breadth of the tabernacle. ^1

2 And the breadth of the door _was_ ten cubits; and the sides of the door _were_ five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits. ^2

3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. ^3

4 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This _is_ the most holy _place_. ^4

5 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of _every_ side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. ^5

6 And the side chambers _were_ three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which _was_ of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house. ^6

7 And _there_ _was_ an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house _was_ _still_ upward, and so increased _from_ the lowest _chamber_ to the highest by the midst. ^7

8 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers _were_ a full reed of six great cubits. ^8

9 The thickness of the wall, which _was_ for the side chamber without, _was_ five cubits: and _that_ which _was_ left _was_ the place of the side chambers that _were_ within. ^9

10 And between the chambers _was_ the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. ^10

11 And the doors of the side chambers _were_ toward _the_ _place_ _that_ _was_ left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left _was_ five cubits round about. ^11

12 Now the building that _was_ before the separate place at the end toward the west _was_ seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building _was_ five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. ^12

13 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; ^13

14 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. ^14

15 And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which _was_ behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court; ^15

16 The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows _were_ covered; ^16

17 To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure. ^17

18 And _it_ _was_ made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree _was_ between a cherub and a cherub; and _every_ cherub had two faces; ^18

19 So that the face of a man _was_ toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: _it_ _was_ made through all the house round about. ^19

20 From the ground unto above the door _were_ cherubims and palm trees made, and _on_ the wall of the temple. ^20

21 The posts of the temple _were_ squared, _and_ the face of the sanctuary; the appearance _of_ _the_ _one_ as the appearance _of_ _the_ _other_. ^21

22 The altar of wood _was_ three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, _were_ of wood: and he said unto me, This _is_ the table that _is_ before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^22

23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. ^23

24 And the doors had two leaves _apiece_, two turning leaves; two _leaves_ for the one door, and two leaves for the other _door_. ^24

25 And _there_ _were_ made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as _were_ made upon the walls; and _there_ _were_ thick planks upon the face of the porch without. ^25

26 And _there_ _were_ narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and _upon_ the side chambers of the house, and thick planks. ^26
