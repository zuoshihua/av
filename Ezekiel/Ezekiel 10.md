### Ezekiel 10

1 THEN I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. ^1

2 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, _even_ under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter _them_ over the city. And he went in in my sight. ^2

3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. ^3

4 Then the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ went up from the cherub, _and_ _stood_ over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the $L{\small ORD}$'s glory. ^4

5 And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard _even_ to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. ^5

6 And it came to pass, _that_ when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. ^6

7 And _one_ cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that _was_ between the cherubims, and took _thereof_, and put _it_ into the hands of _him_ _that_ _was_ clothed with linen: who took _it_, and went out. ^7

8 Â¶ And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings. ^8

9 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels _was_ as the colour of a beryl stone. ^9

10 And _as_ _for_ their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. ^10

11 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. ^11

12 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, _were_ full of eyes round about, _even_ the wheels that they four had. ^12

13 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. ^13

14 And every one had four faces: the first face _was_ the face of a cherub, and the second face _was_ the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. ^14

15 And the cherubims were lifted up. This _is_ the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. ^15

16 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. ^16

17 When they stood, _these_ stood; and when they were lifted up, _these_ lifted up themselves _also:_ for the spirit of the living creature _was_ in them. ^17

18 Then the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. ^18

19 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also _were_ beside them, and _every_ _one_ stood at the door of the east gate of the $L{\small ORD}$'s house; and the glory of the God of Israel _was_ over them above. ^19

20 This _is_ the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they _were_ the cherubims. ^20

21 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man _was_ under their wings. ^21

22 And the likeness of their faces _was_ the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward. ^22
