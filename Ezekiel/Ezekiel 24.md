### Ezekiel 24

1 AGAIN in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth _day_ of the month, the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^1

2 Son of man, write thee the name of the day, _even_ of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day. ^2

3 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Set on a pot, set _it_ on, and also pour water into it: ^3

4 Gather the pieces thereof into it, _even_ every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill _it_ with the choice bones. ^4

5 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, _and_ make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein. ^5

6 ¶ Wherefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum _is_ therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it. ^6

7 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; ^7

8 That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. ^8

9 Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great. ^9

10 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. ^10

11 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and _that_ the filthiness of it may be molten in it, _that_ the scum of it may be consumed. ^11

12 She hath wearied _herself_ with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum _shall_ _be_ in the fire. ^12

13 In thy filthiness _is_ lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. ^13

14 I the $L{\small ORD}$ have spoken _it:_ it shall come to pass, and I will do _it;_ I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^14

15 ¶ Also the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^15

16 Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. ^16

17 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not _thy_ lips, and eat not the bread of men. ^17

18 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded. ^18

19 ¶ And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these _things_ _are_ to us, that thou doest _so?_ ^19

20 Then I answered them, The word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^20

21 Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. ^21

22 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover _your_ lips, nor eat the bread of men. ^22

23 And your tires _shall_ _be_ upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another. ^23

24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I _am_ the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^24

25 Also, thou son of man, _shall_ _it_ not _be_ in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, ^25

26 _That_ he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause _thee_ to hear _it_ with _thine_ ears? ^26

27 In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^27
