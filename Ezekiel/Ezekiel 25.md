### Ezekiel 25

1 THE word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came again unto me, saying, ^1

2 Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; ^2

3 And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; ^3

4 Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. ^4

5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 For thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Because thou hast clapped _thine_ hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel; ^6

7 Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^7

8 ¶ Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah _is_ like unto all the heathen; ^8

9 Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities _which_ _are_ on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, ^9

10 Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. ^10

11 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^11

12 ¶ Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; ^12

13 Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. ^13

14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^14

15 ¶ Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy _it_ for the old hatred; ^15

16 Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. ^16

17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them. ^17
