### Ezekiel 11

1 MOREOVER the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the $L{\small ORD}$'s house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. ^1

2 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these _are_ the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: ^2

3 Which say, _It_ _is_ not near; let us build houses: this _city_ _is_ the caldron, and we _be_ the flesh. ^3

4 ¶ Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. ^4

5 And the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, _every_ _one_ _of_ them. ^5

6 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. ^6

7 Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they _are_ the flesh, and this _city_ _is_ the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. ^7

8 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^8

9 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. ^9

10 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^10

11 This _city_ shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; _but_ I will judge you in the border of Israel: ^11

12 And ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that _are_ round about you. ^12

13 ¶ And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord $G{\small OD}$! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? ^13

14 Again the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^14

15 Son of man, thy brethren, _even_ thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, _are_ they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the $L{\small ORD}$: unto us is this land given in possession. ^15

16 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. ^16

17 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. ^17

18 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. ^18

19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: ^19

20 That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. ^20

21 But _as_ _for_ _them_ whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^21

22 ¶ Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel _was_ over them above. ^22

23 And the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which _is_ on the east side of the city. ^23

24 ¶ Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. ^24

25 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the $L{\small ORD}$ had shewed me. ^25
