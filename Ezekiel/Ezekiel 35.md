### Ezekiel 35

1 MOREOVER the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^1

2 Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, ^2

3 And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Behold, O mount Seir, I _am_ against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. ^3

4 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^4

5 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed _the_ _blood_ _of_ the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time _that_ _their_ iniquity _had_ an end: ^5

6 Therefore, _as_ I live, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee. ^6

7 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. ^7

8 And I will fill his mountains with his slain _men:_ in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword. ^8

9 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^9

10 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the $L{\small ORD}$ was there: ^10

11 Therefore, _as_ I live, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee. ^11

12 And thou shalt know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$, _and_ _that_ I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. ^12

13 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard _them_. ^13

14 Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. ^14

15 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, _even_ all of it: and they shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^15
