### Ezekiel 40

1 IN the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth _day_ of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the $L{\small ORD}$ was upon me, and brought me thither. ^1

2 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which _was_ as the frame of a city on the south. ^2

3 And he brought me thither, and, behold, _there_ _was_ a man, whose appearance _was_ like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. ^3

4 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew _them_ unto thee _art_ thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. ^4

5 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits _long_ by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. ^5

6 ¶ Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, _which_ _was_ one reed broad; and the other threshold _of_ _the_ _gate_, _which_ _was_ one reed broad. ^6

7 And _every_ little chamber _was_ one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers _were_ five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within _was_ one reed. ^7

8 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed. ^8

9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate _was_ inward. ^9

10 And the little chambers of the gate eastward _were_ three on this side, and three on that side; they three _were_ of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. ^10

11 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; _and_ the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. ^11

12 The space also before the little chambers _was_ one cubit _on_ _this_ _side_, and the space _was_ one cubit on that side: and the little chambers _were_ six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. ^12

13 He measured then the gate from the roof of _one_ little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth _was_ five and twenty cubits, door against door. ^13

14 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate. ^14

15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate _were_ fifty cubits. ^15

16 And _there_ _were_ narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows _were_ round about inward: and upon _each_ post _were_ palm trees. ^16

17 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, _there_ _were_ chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers _were_ upon the pavement. ^17

18 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates _was_ the lower pavement. ^18

19 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward. ^19

20 ¶ And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof. ^20

21 And the little chambers thereof _were_ three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof _was_ fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. ^21

22 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, _were_ after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof _were_ before them. ^22

23 And the gate of the inner court _was_ over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits. ^23

24 ¶ After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. ^24

25 And _there_ _were_ windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length _was_ fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. ^25

26 And _there_ _were_ seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof _were_ before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. ^26

27 And _there_ _was_ a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits. ^27

28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; ^28

29 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and _there_ _were_ windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: _it_ _was_ fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. ^29

30 And the arches round about _were_ five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. ^30

31 And the arches thereof _were_ toward the utter court; and palm trees _were_ upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it _had_ eight steps. ^31

32 ¶ And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures. ^32

33 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, _were_ according to these measures: and _there_ _were_ windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: _it_ _was_ fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. ^33

34 And the arches thereof _were_ toward the outward court; and palm trees _were_ upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it _had_ eight steps. ^34

35 ¶ And he brought me to the north gate, and measured _it_ according to these measures; ^35

36 The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length _was_ fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. ^36

37 And the posts thereof _were_ toward the utter court; and palm trees _were_ upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it _had_ eight steps. ^37

38 And the chambers and the entries thereof _were_ by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering. ^38

39 ¶ And in the porch of the gate _were_ two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering. ^39

40 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, _were_ two tables; and on the other side, which _was_ at the porch of the gate, _were_ two tables. ^40

41 Four tables _were_ on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew _their_ _sacrifices_. ^41

42 And the four tables _were_ of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. ^42

43 And within _were_ hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables _was_ the flesh of the offering. ^43

44 ¶ And without the inner gate _were_ the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which _was_ at the side of the north gate; and their prospect _was_ toward the south: one at the side of the east gate _having_ the prospect toward the north. ^44

45 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect _is_ toward the south, _is_ for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. ^45

46 And the chamber whose prospect _is_ toward the north _is_ for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these _are_ the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the $L{\small ORD}$ to minister unto him. ^46

47 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar _that_ _was_ before the house. ^47

48 ¶ And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured _each_ post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate _was_ three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. ^48

49 The length of the porch _was_ twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and _he_ _brought_ _me_ by the steps whereby they went up to it: and _there_ _were_ pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. ^49
