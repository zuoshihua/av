### Ezekiel 13

1 AND the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto me, saying, ^1

2 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the $L{\small ORD}$; ^2

3 Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! ^3

4 O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts. ^4

5 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The $L{\small ORD}$ saith: and the $L{\small ORD}$ hath not sent them: and they have made _others_ to hope that they would confirm the word. ^6

7 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The $L{\small ORD}$ saith _it;_ albeit I have not spoken? ^7

8 Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I _am_ against you, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^8

9 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I _am_ the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^9

10 ¶ Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and _there_ _was_ no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered _morter:_ ^10

11 Say unto them which daub _it_ with untempered _morter_, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend _it_. ^11

12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where _is_ the daubing wherewith ye have daubed _it?_ ^12

13 Therefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; I will even rend _it_ with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in _my_ fury to consume _it_. ^13

14 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered _morter_, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered _morter_, and will say unto you, The wall _is_ no _more_, neither they that daubed it; ^15

16 _To_ _wit_, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and _there_ _is_ no peace, saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$. ^16

17 ¶ Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them, ^17

18 And say, Thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Woe to the _women_ that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive _that_ _come_ unto you? ^18

19 And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear _your_ lies? ^19

20 Wherefore thus saith the Lord $G{\small OD}$; Behold, I _am_ against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make _them_ fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, _even_ the souls that ye hunt to make _them_ fly. ^20

21 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21

22 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life: ^22

23 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I _am_ the $L{\small ORD}$. ^23
