### Hebrews 8

1 NOW of the things which we have spoken _this_ _is_ the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; ^1

2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. ^2

3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore _it_ _is_ of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. ^3

4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: ^4

5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, _that_ thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. ^5

6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. ^6

7 For if that first _covenant_ had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. ^7

8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: ^8

9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. ^9

10 For this _is_ the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: ^10

11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. ^11

12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. ^12

13 In that he saith, A new _covenant_, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old _is_ ready to vanish away. ^13
