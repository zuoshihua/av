### Hebrews 13

1 LET brotherly love continue. ^1

2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. ^2

3 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; _and_ them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. ^3

4 Marriage _is_ honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. ^4

5 _Let_ _your_ conversation _be_ without covetousness; _and_ _be_ content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. ^5

6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord _is_ my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. ^6

7 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of _their_ conversation. ^7

8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. ^8

9 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For _it_ _is_ a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. ^9

10 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. ^10

11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. ^11

12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. ^12

13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. ^13

14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. ^14

15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of _our_ lips giving thanks to his name. ^15

16 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. ^16

17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that _is_ unprofitable for you. ^17

18 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. ^18

19 But I beseech _you_ the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. ^19

20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, ^20

21 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom _be_ glory for ever and ever. Amen. ^21

22 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. ^22

23 Know ye that _our_ brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. ^23

24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. ^24

25 Grace _be_ with you all. Amen. ^25
