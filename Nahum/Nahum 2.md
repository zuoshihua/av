### Nahum 2

1 HE that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make _thy_ loins strong, fortify _thy_ power mightily. ^1

2 For the $L{\small ORD}$ hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches. ^2

3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men _are_ in scarlet: the chariots _shall_ _be_ with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken. ^3

4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings. ^4

5 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. ^5

6 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved. ^6

7 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead _her_ as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts. ^7

8 But Nineveh _is_ of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, _shall_ _they_ _cry;_ but none shall look back. ^8

9 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for _there_ _is_ none end of the store _and_ glory out of all the pleasant furniture. ^9

10 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain _is_ in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness. ^10

11 Where _is_ the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, _even_ the old lion, walked, _and_ the lion's whelp, and none made _them_ afraid? ^11

12 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin. ^12

13 Behold, I _am_ against thee, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard. ^13
