### Nahum 1

1 THE burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. ^1

2 God _is_ jealous, and the $L{\small ORD}$ revengeth; the $L{\small ORD}$ revengeth, and _is_ furious; the $L{\small ORD}$ will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth _wrath_ for his enemies. ^2

3 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit _the_ _wicked:_ the $L{\small ORD}$ _hath_ his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds _are_ the dust of his feet. ^3

4 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. ^4

5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. ^5

6 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. ^6

7 The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. ^7

8 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. ^8

9 What do ye imagine against the $L{\small ORD}$? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time. ^9

10 For while _they_ _be_ folden together _as_ thorns, and while they are drunken _as_ drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry. ^10

11 There is _one_ come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the $L{\small ORD}$, a wicked counseller. ^11

12 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Though _they_ _be_ quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. ^12

13 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. ^13

14 And the $L{\small ORD}$ hath given a commandment concerning thee, _that_ no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile. ^14

15 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off. ^15
