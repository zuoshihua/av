### Nahum 3

1 WOE to the bloody city! it _is_ all full of lies _and_ robbery; the prey departeth not; ^1

2 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots. ^2

3 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and _there_ _is_ a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and _there_ _is_ none end of _their_ corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: ^3

4 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. ^4

5 Behold, I _am_ against thee, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. ^5

6 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock. ^6

7 And it shall come to pass, _that_ all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee? ^7

8 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, _that_ _had_ the waters round about it, whose rampart _was_ the sea, _and_ her wall _was_ from the sea? ^8

9 Ethiopia and Egypt _were_ her strength, and _it_ _was_ infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. ^9

10 Yet _was_ she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. ^10

11 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy. ^11

12 All thy strong holds _shall_ _be_ _like_ fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater. ^12

13 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee _are_ women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars. ^13

14 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln. ^14

15 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts. ^15

16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away. ^16

17 Thy crowned _are_ as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, _but_ when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they _are_. ^17

18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell _in_ _the_ _dust:_ thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth _them_. ^18

19 _There_ _is_ no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually? ^19
