### Malachi 1

1 THE burden of the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ to Israel by Malachi. ^1

2 I have loved you, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? _Was_ not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the $L{\small ORD}$: yet I loved Jacob, ^2

3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. ^3

4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the $L{\small ORD}$ hath indignation for ever. ^4

5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The $L{\small ORD}$ will be magnified from the border of Israel. ^5

6 ¶ A son honoureth _his_ father, and a servant his master: if then I _be_ a father, where _is_ mine honour? and if I _be_ a master, where _is_ my fear? saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? ^6

7 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ contemptible. ^7

8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, _is_ _it_ not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, _is_ _it_ not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^8

9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^9

10 Who _is_ _there_ even among you that would shut the doors _for_ _nought?_ neither do ye kindle _fire_ on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. ^10

11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name _shall_ _be_ great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense _shall_ _be_ offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name _shall_ _be_ great among the heathen, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^11

12 ¶ But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ polluted; and the fruit thereof, _even_ his meat, _is_ contemptible. ^12

13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness _is_ _it!_ and ye have snuffed at it, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; and ye brought _that_ _which_ _was_ torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 But cursed _be_ the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I _am_ a great King, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, and my name _is_ dreadful among the heathen. ^14
