### Malachi 2

1 AND now, O ye priests, this commandment _is_ for you. ^1

2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay _it_ to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay _it_ to heart. ^2

3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, _even_ the dung of your solemn feasts; and _one_ shall take you away with it. ^3

4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^4

5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him _for_ the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name. ^5

6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity. ^6

7 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he _is_ the messenger of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^7

8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^8

9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law. ^9

10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers? ^10

11 ¶ Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the $L{\small ORD}$ which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god. ^11

12 The $L{\small ORD}$ will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^12

13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the $L{\small ORD}$ with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth _it_ with good will at your hand. ^13

14 ¶ Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the $L{\small ORD}$ hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet _is_ she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. ^14

15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. ^15

16 For the $L{\small ORD}$, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for _one_ covereth violence with his garment, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously. ^16

17 ¶ Ye have wearied the $L{\small ORD}$ with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied _him?_ When ye say, Every one that doeth evil _is_ good in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, and he delighteth in them; or, Where _is_ the God of judgment? ^17
