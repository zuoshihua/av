### Micah 1

1 THE word of the $L{\small ORD}$ that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. ^1

2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord $G{\small OD}$ be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. ^2

3 For, behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. ^3

4 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, _and_ as the waters _that_ _are_ poured down a steep place. ^4

5 For the transgression of Jacob _is_ all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What _is_ the transgression of Jacob? _is_ _it_ not Samaria? and what _are_ the high places of Judah? _are_ _they_ not Jerusalem? ^5

6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, _and_ as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof. ^6

7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered _it_ of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot. ^7

8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. ^8

9 For her wound _is_ incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, _even_ to Jerusalem. ^9

10 Â¶ Declare ye _it_ not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust. ^10

11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing. ^11

12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the $L{\small ORD}$ unto the gate of Jerusalem. ^12

13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she _is_ the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee. ^13

14 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib _shall_ _be_ a lie to the kings of Israel. ^14

15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel. ^15

16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee. ^16
