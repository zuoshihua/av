### Micah 2

1 WOE to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. ^1

2 And they covet fields, and take _them_ by violence; and houses, and take _them_ away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. ^2

3 Therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time _is_ evil. ^3

4 ¶ In that day shall _one_ take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, _and_ say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed _it_ from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. ^4

5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 Prophesy ye not, _say_ _they_ _to_ _them_ _that_ prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, _that_ they shall not take shame. ^6

7 ¶ O _thou_ _that_ _art_ named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ straitened? _are_ these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? ^7

8 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. ^8

9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. ^9

10 Arise ye, and depart; for this _is_ not _your_ rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy _you_, even with a sore destruction. ^10

11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, _saying_, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. ^11

12 ¶ I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of _the_ _multitude_ _of_ men. ^12

13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the $L{\small ORD}$ on the head of them. ^13
