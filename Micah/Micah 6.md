### Micah 6

1 HEAR ye now what the $L{\small ORD}$ saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. ^1

2 Hear ye, O mountains, the $L{\small ORD}$'s controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel. ^2

3 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. ^3

4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. ^4

5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^5

6 ¶ Wherewith shall I come before the $L{\small ORD}$, _and_ bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? ^6

7 Will the $L{\small ORD}$ be pleased with thousands of rams, _or_ with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn _for_ my transgression, the fruit of my body _for_ the sin of my soul? ^7

8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what _is_ good; and what doth the $L{\small ORD}$ require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? ^8

9 The $L{\small ORD}$'s voice crieth unto the city, and _the_ _man_ _of_ wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. ^9

10 ¶ Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure _that_ _is_ abominable? ^10

11 Shall I count _them_ pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights? ^11

12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue _is_ deceitful in their mouth. ^12

13 Therefore also will I make _thee_ sick in smiting thee, in making _thee_ desolate because of thy sins. ^13

14 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down _shall_ _be_ in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and _that_ which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword. ^14

15 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. ^15

16 ¶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people. ^16
