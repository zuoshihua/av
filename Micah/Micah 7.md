### Micah 7

1 WOE is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: _there_ _is_ no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit. ^1

2 The good _man_ is perished out of the earth: and _there_ _is_ none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. ^2

3 ¶ That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge _asketh_ for a reward; and the great _man_, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up. ^3

4 The best of them _is_ as a brier: the most upright _is_ _sharper_ than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen _and_ thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity. ^4

5 ¶ Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. ^5

6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies _are_ the men of his own house. ^6

7 Therefore I will look unto the $L{\small ORD}$; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. ^7

8 ¶ Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the $L{\small ORD}$ _shall_ _be_ a light unto me. ^8

9 I will bear the indignation of the $L{\small ORD}$, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, _and_ I shall behold his righteousness. ^9

10 Then _she_ _that_ _is_ mine enemy shall see _it_, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the $L{\small ORD}$ thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. ^10

11 _In_ the day that thy walls are to be built, _in_ that day shall the decree be far removed. ^11

12 _In_ that day _also_ he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and _from_ the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and _from_ mountain to mountain. ^12

13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. ^13

14 ¶ Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily _in_ the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed _in_ Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. ^14

15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous _things_. ^15

16 ¶ The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay _their_ hand upon _their_ mouth, their ears shall be deaf. ^16

17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, and shall fear because of thee. ^17

18 Who _is_ a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth _in_ mercy. ^18

19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. ^19

20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, _and_ the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. ^20
