### Haggai 2

1 IN the seventh _month_, in the one and twentieth _day_ of the month, came the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ by the prophet Haggai, saying, ^1

2 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, ^2

3 Who _is_ left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? _is_ _it_ not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? ^3

4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, and work: for I _am_ with you, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts: ^4

5 _According_ _to_ the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. ^5

6 For thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Yet once, it _is_ a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry _land;_ ^6

7 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^7

8 The silver _is_ mine, and the gold _is_ mine, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^8

9 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^9

10 ¶ In the four and twentieth _day_ of the ninth _month_, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ by Haggai the prophet, saying, ^10

11 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Ask now the priests _concerning_ the law, saying, ^11

12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. ^12

13 Then said Haggai, If _one_ _that_ _is_ unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean. ^13

14 Then answered Haggai, and said, So _is_ this people, and so _is_ this nation before me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$; and so _is_ every work of their hands; and that which they offer there _is_ unclean. ^14

15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$: ^15

16 Since those _days_ were, when _one_ came to an heap of twenty _measures_, there were _but_ ten: when _one_ came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty _vessels_ out of the press, there were _but_ twenty. ^16

17 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye _turned_ not to me, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^17

18 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth _month_, _even_ from the day that the foundation of the $L{\small ORD}$'s temple was laid, consider _it_. ^18

19 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless _you_. ^19

20 ¶ And again the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth _day_ of the month, saying, ^20

21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; ^21

22 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. ^22

23 In that day, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the $L{\small ORD}$, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. ^23
