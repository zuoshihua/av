### Haggai 1

1 IN the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying, ^1

2 Thus speaketh the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the $L{\small ORD}$'s house should be built. ^2

3 Then came the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ by Haggai the prophet, saying, ^3

4 _Is_ _it_ time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house _lie_ waste? ^4

5 Now therefore thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Consider your ways. ^5

6 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages _to_ _put_ _it_ into a bag with holes. ^6

7 ¶ Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts; Consider your ways. ^7

8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^8

9 Ye looked for much, and, lo, _it_ _came_ to little; and when ye brought _it_ home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts. Because of mine house that _is_ waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. ^9

10 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed _from_ her fruit. ^10

11 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon _that_ which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands. ^11

12 ¶ Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the $L{\small ORD}$ their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the $L{\small ORD}$ their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the $L{\small ORD}$. ^12

13 Then spake Haggai the $L{\small ORD}$'s messenger in the $L{\small ORD}$'s message unto the people, saying, I _am_ with you, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^13

14 And the $L{\small ORD}$ stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ of hosts, their God, ^14

15 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king. ^15
