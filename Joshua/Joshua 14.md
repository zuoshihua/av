### Joshua 14

1 AND these _are_ _the_ _countries_ which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them. ^1

2 By lot _was_ their inheritance, as the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and _for_ the half tribe. ^2

3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them. ^3

4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell _in_, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance. ^4

5 As the $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land. ^5

6 Â¶ Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea. ^6

7 Forty years old _was_ I when Moses the servant of the $L{\small ORD}$ sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as _it_ _was_ in mine heart. ^7

8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the $L{\small ORD}$ my God. ^8

9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the $L{\small ORD}$ my God. ^9

10 And now, behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the $L{\small ORD}$ spake this word unto Moses, while _the_ _children_ _of_ Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I _am_ this day fourscore and five years old. ^10

11 As yet I _am_ _as_ strong this day as _I_ _was_ in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength _was_ then, even so _is_ my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in. ^11

12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the $L{\small ORD}$ spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims _were_ there, and _that_ the cities _were_ great _and_ fenced: if so be the $L{\small ORD}$ _will_ _be_ with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the $L{\small ORD}$ said. ^12

13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance. ^13

14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel. ^14

15 And the name of Hebron before _was_ Kirjath-arba; _which_ _Arba_ _was_ a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war. ^15
