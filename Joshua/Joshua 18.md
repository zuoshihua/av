### Joshua 18

1 AND the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them. ^1

2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. ^2

3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long _are_ ye slack to go to possess the land, which the $L{\small ORD}$ God of your fathers hath given you? ^3

4 Give out from among you three men for _each_ tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come _again_ to me. ^4

5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north. ^5

6 Ye shall therefore describe the land _into_ seven parts, and bring _the_ _description_ hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the $L{\small ORD}$ our God. ^6

7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the $L{\small ORD}$ gave them. ^7

8 ¶ And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the $L{\small ORD}$ in Shiloh. ^8

9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came _again_ to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. ^9

10 ¶ And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the $L{\small ORD}$: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions. ^10

11 ¶ And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. ^11

12 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. ^12

13 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which _is_ Beth-el, southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that _lieth_ on the south side of the nether Beth-horon. ^13

14 And the border was drawn _thence_, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that _lieth_ before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which _is_ Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this _was_ the west quarter. ^14

15 And the south quarter _was_ from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah: ^15

16 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that _lieth_ before the valley of the son of Hinnom, _and_ which _is_ in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel, ^16

17 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which _is_ over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, ^17

18 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah: ^18

19 And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this _was_ the south coast. ^19

20 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This _was_ the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families. ^20

21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz, ^21

22 And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el, ^22

23 And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah, ^23

24 And Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages: ^24

25 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, ^25

26 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, ^26

27 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, ^27

28 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which _is_ Jerusalem, Gibeath, _and_ Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This _is_ the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families. ^28
