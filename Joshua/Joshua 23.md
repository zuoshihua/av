### Joshua 23

1 AND it came to pass a long time after that the $L{\small ORD}$ had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old _and_ stricken in age. ^1

2 And Joshua called for all Israel, _and_ for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old _and_ stricken in age: ^2

3 And ye have seen all that the $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the $L{\small ORD}$ your God _is_ he that hath fought for you. ^3

4 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward. ^4

5 And the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath promised unto you. ^5

6 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom _to_ the right hand or _to_ the left; ^6

7 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear _by_ _them_, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: ^7

8 But cleave unto the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, as ye have done unto this day. ^8

9 For the $L{\small ORD}$ hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but _as_ _for_ you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day. ^9

10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, he _it_ _is_ that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you. ^10

11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the $L{\small ORD}$ your God. ^11

12 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, _even_ these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: ^12

13 Know for a certainty that the $L{\small ORD}$ your God will no more drive out _any_ _of_ these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath given you. ^13

14 And, behold, this day I _am_ going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the $L{\small ORD}$ your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, _and_ not one thing hath failed thereof. ^14

15 Therefore it shall come to pass, _that_ as all good things are come upon you, which the $L{\small ORD}$ your God promised you; so shall the $L{\small ORD}$ bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the $L{\small ORD}$ your God hath given you. ^15

16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the $L{\small ORD}$ be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you. ^16
