### Joshua 17

1 THERE was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he _was_ the firstborn of Joseph; _to_ _wit_, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. ^1

2 There was also _a_ _lot_ for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these _were_ the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families. ^2

3 ¶ But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these _are_ the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. ^3

4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The $L{\small ORD}$ commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. ^4

5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which _were_ on the other side Jordan; ^5

6 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead. ^6

7 ¶ And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that _lieth_ before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah. ^7

8 _Now_ Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh _belonged_ to the children of Ephraim; ^8

9 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim _are_ among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also _was_ on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea: ^9

10 Southward _it_ _was_ Ephraim's, and northward _it_ _was_ Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east. ^10

11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, _even_ three countries. ^11

12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out _the_ _inhabitants_ _of_ those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. ^12

13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out. ^13

14 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me _but_ one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I _am_ a great people, forasmuch as the $L{\small ORD}$ hath blessed me hitherto? ^14

15 And Joshua answered them, If thou _be_ a great people, _then_ get thee up to the wood _country_, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee. ^15

16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, _both_ _they_ who _are_ of Beth-shean and her towns, and _they_ who _are_ of the valley of Jezreel. ^16

17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, _even_ to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou _art_ a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot _only:_ ^17

18 But the mountain shall be thine; for it _is_ a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, _and_ though they _be_ strong. ^18
