### 2 Chronicles 27

1 JOTHAM _was_ twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also _was_ Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. ^1

2 And he did _that_ _which_ _was_ right in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$. And the people did yet corruptly. ^2

3 He built the high gate of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and on the wall of Ophel he built much. ^3

4 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. ^4

5 ¶ He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third. ^5

6 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the $L{\small ORD}$ his God. ^6

7 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they _are_ written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. ^7

8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. ^8

9 ¶ And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead. ^9
