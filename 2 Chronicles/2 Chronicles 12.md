### 2 Chronicles 12

1 AND it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the $L{\small ORD}$, and all Israel with him. ^1

2 And it came to pass, _that_ in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the $L{\small ORD}$, ^2

3 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people _were_ without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. ^3

4 And he took the fenced cities which _pertained_ to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. ^4

5 ¶ Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and _to_ the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak. ^5

6 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ righteous. ^6

7 And when the $L{\small ORD}$ saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; _therefore_ I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. ^7

8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. ^8

9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. ^9

10 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed _them_ to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house. ^10

11 And when the king entered into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber. ^11

12 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the $L{\small ORD}$ turned from him, that he would not destroy _him_ altogether: and also in Judah things went well. ^12

13 ¶ So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam _was_ one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the $L{\small ORD}$ had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name _was_ Naamah an Ammonitess. ^13

14 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the $L{\small ORD}$. ^14

15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, _are_ they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And _there_ _were_ wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. ^15

16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead. ^16
