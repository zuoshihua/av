### 2 Chronicles 3

1 THEN Solomon began to build the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where _the_ _$L{\small ORD}$_ appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. ^1

2 And he began to build in the second _day_ of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. ^2

3 ¶ Now these _are_ _the_ _things_ _wherein_ Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure _was_ threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. ^3

4 And the porch that _was_ in the front _of_ _the_ _house_, the length _of_ _it_ _was_ according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height _was_ an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold. ^4

5 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains. ^5

6 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold _was_ gold of Parvaim. ^6

7 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls. ^7

8 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof _was_ according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, _amounting_ to six hundred talents. ^8

9 And the weight of the nails _was_ fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold. ^9

10 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold. ^10

11 ¶ And the wings of the cherubims _were_ twenty cubits long: one wing _of_ _the_ _one_ _cherub_ _was_ five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing _was_ _likewise_ five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. ^11

12 And _one_ wing of the other cherub _was_ five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing _was_ five cubits _also_, joining to the wing of the other cherub. ^12

13 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces _were_ inward. ^13

14 ¶ And he made the vail _of_ blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon. ^14

15 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that _was_ on the top of each of them _was_ five cubits. ^15

16 And he made chains, _as_ in the oracle, and put _them_ on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put _them_ on the chains. ^16

17 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. ^17
