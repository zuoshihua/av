### 2 Chronicles 5

1 THUS all the work that Solomon made for the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ was finished: and Solomon brought in _all_ the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God. ^1

2 ¶ Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ out of the city of David, which _is_ Zion. ^2

3 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which _was_ in the seventh month. ^3

4 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark. ^4

5 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that _were_ in the tabernacle, these did the priests _and_ the Levites bring up. ^5

6 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude. ^6

7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the $L{\small ORD}$ unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy _place_, _even_ under the wings of the cherubims: ^7

8 For the cherubims spread forth _their_ wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. ^8

9 And they drew out the staves _of_ _the_ _ark_, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day. ^9

10 _There_ _was_ nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put _therein_ at Horeb, when the $L{\small ORD}$ made _a_ _covenant_ with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. ^10

11 ¶ And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy _place:_ (for all the priests _that_ _were_ present were sanctified, _and_ did not _then_ wait by course: ^11

12 Also the Levites _which_ _were_ the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, _being_ arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) ^12

13 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers _were_ as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the $L{\small ORD}$; and when they lifted up _their_ voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the $L{\small ORD}$, _saying_, For _he_ _is_ good; for his mercy _endureth_ for ever: that _then_ the house was filled with a cloud, _even_ the house of the $L{\small ORD}$; ^13

14 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the $L{\small ORD}$ had filled the house of God. ^14
