### 2 Chronicles 29

1 HEZEKIAH began to reign _when_ _he_ _was_ five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name _was_ Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. ^1

2 And he did _that_ _which_ _was_ right in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, according to all that David his father had done. ^2

3 ¶ He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and repaired them. ^3

4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street, ^4

5 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy _place_. ^5

6 For our fathers have trespassed, and done _that_ _which_ _was_ evil in the eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the $L{\small ORD}$, and turned _their_ backs. ^6

7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy _place_ unto the God of Israel. ^7

8 Wherefore the wrath of the $L{\small ORD}$ was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes. ^8

9 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives _are_ in captivity for this. ^9

10 Now _it_ _is_ in mine heart to make a covenant with the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. ^10

11 My sons, be not now negligent: for the $L{\small ORD}$ hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense. ^11

12 ¶ Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: ^12

13 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: ^13

14 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel. ^14

15 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the $L{\small ORD}$, to cleanse the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^15

16 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, to cleanse _it_, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the $L{\small ORD}$ into the court of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. And the Levites took _it_, to carry _it_ out abroad into the brook Kidron. ^16

17 Now they began on the first _day_ of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the $L{\small ORD}$: so they sanctified the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. ^17

18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof. ^18

19 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they _are_ before the altar of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^19

20 ¶ Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^20

21 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer _them_ on the altar of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^21

22 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled _it_ on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar. ^22

23 And they brought forth the he goats _for_ the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them: ^23

24 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded _that_ the burnt offering and the sin offering _should_ _be_ _made_ for all Israel. ^24

25 And he set the Levites in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for _so_ _was_ the commandment of the $L{\small ORD}$ by his prophets. ^25

26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. ^26

27 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the $L{\small ORD}$ began _also_ with the trumpets, and with the instruments _ordained_ by David king of Israel. ^27

28 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: _and_ all _this_ _continued_ until the burnt offering was finished. ^28

29 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped. ^29

30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the $L{\small ORD}$ with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped. ^30

31 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the $L{\small ORD}$, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings. ^31

32 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, _and_ two hundred lambs: all these _were_ for a burnt offering to the $L{\small ORD}$. ^32

33 And the consecrated things _were_ six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. ^33

34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the _other_ priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites _were_ more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. ^34

35 And also the burnt offerings _were_ in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for _every_ burnt offering. So the service of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ was set in order. ^35

36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was _done_ suddenly. ^36
