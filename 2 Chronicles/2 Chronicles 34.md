### 2 Chronicles 34

1 JOSIAH _was_ eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years. ^1

2 And he did _that_ _which_ _was_ right in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined _neither_ to the right hand, nor to the left. ^2

3 ¶ For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. ^3

4 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that _were_ on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust _of_ _them_, and strowed _it_ upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. ^4

5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. ^5

6 And _so_ _did_ _he_ in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about. ^6

7 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem. ^7

8 ¶ Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ his God. ^8

9 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem. ^9

10 And they put _it_ in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, to repair and amend the house: ^10

11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they _it_, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. ^11

12 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them _were_ Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set _it_ forward; and _other_ _of_ the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick. ^12

13 Also _they_ _were_ over the bearers of burdens, and _were_ overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites _there_ _were_ scribes, and officers, and porters. ^13

14 ¶ And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the $L{\small ORD}$ _given_ by Moses. ^14

15 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. ^15

16 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do _it_. ^16

17 And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen. ^17

18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. ^18

19 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes. ^19

20 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying, ^20

21 Go, inquire of the $L{\small ORD}$ for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great _is_ the wrath of the $L{\small ORD}$ that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the $L{\small ORD}$, to do after all that is written in this book. ^21

22 And Hilkiah, and _they_ that the king _had_ _appointed_, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that _effect_. ^22

23 ¶ And she answered them, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me, ^23

24 Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, _even_ all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah: ^24

25 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched. ^25

26 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the $L{\small ORD}$, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$ God of Israel _concerning_ the words which thou hast heard; ^26

27 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard _thee_ also, saith the $L{\small ORD}$. ^27

28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again. ^28

29 ¶ Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. ^29

30 And the king went up into the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the $L{\small ORD}$. ^30

31 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the $L{\small ORD}$, to walk after the $L{\small ORD}$, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book. ^31

32 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand _to_ _it_. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. ^32

33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that _pertained_ to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, _even_ to serve the $L{\small ORD}$ their God. _And_ all his days they departed not from following the $L{\small ORD}$, the God of their fathers. ^33
