### 2 Chronicles 18

1 NOW Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab. ^1

2 And after _certain_ years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that _he_ _had_ with him, and persuaded him to go up _with_ _him_ to Ramoth-gilead. ^2

3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I _am_ as thou _art_, and my people as thy people; and _we_ _will_ _be_ with thee in the war. ^3

4 Â¶ And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the $L{\small ORD}$ to day. ^4

5 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver _it_ into the king's hand. ^5

6 But Jehoshaphat said, _Is_ _there_ not here a prophet of the $L{\small ORD}$ besides, that we might inquire of him? ^6

7 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, _There_ _is_ yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the $L{\small ORD}$: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same _is_ Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. ^7

8 And the king of Israel called for one _of_ _his_ officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. ^8

9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in _their_ robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. ^9

10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the $L{\small ORD}$, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed. ^10

11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the $L{\small ORD}$ shall deliver _it_ into the hand of the king. ^11

12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets _declare_ good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good. ^12

13 And Micaiah said, _As_ the $L{\small ORD}$ liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak. ^13

14 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand. ^14

15 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the $L{\small ORD}$? ^15

16 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the $L{\small ORD}$ said, These have no master; let them return _therefore_ every man to his house in peace. ^16

17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee _that_ he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil? ^17

18 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the $L{\small ORD}$; I saw the $L{\small ORD}$ sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and _on_ his left. ^18

19 And the $L{\small ORD}$ said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner. ^19

20 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the $L{\small ORD}$, and said, I will entice him. And the $L{\small ORD}$ said unto him, Wherewith? ^20

21 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And _the_ _$L{\small ORD}$_ said, Thou shalt entice _him_, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do _even_ so. ^21

22 Now therefore, behold, the $L{\small ORD}$ hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the $L{\small ORD}$ hath spoken evil against thee. ^22

23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the $L{\small ORD}$ from me to speak unto thee? ^23

24 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. ^24

25 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; ^25

26 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this _fellow_ in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace. ^26

27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, _then_ hath not the $L{\small ORD}$ spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people. ^27

28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. ^28

29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle. ^29

30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that _were_ with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel. ^30

31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It _is_ the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the $L{\small ORD}$ helped him; and God moved them _to_ _depart_ from him. ^31

32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him. ^32

33 And a _certain_ man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. ^33

34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed _himself_ up in _his_ chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died. ^34
