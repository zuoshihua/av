### 2 Chronicles 28

1 AHAZ _was_ twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not _that_ _which_ _was_ right in the sight of the $L{\small ORD}$, like David his father: ^1

2 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim. ^2

3 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the $L{\small ORD}$ had cast out before the children of Israel. ^3

4 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. ^4

5 Wherefore the $L{\small ORD}$ his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought _them_ to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. ^5

6 ¶ For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, _which_ _were_ all valiant men; because they had forsaken the $L{\small ORD}$ God of their fathers. ^6

7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah _that_ _was_ next to the king. ^7

8 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. ^8

9 But a prophet of the $L{\small ORD}$ was there, whose name _was_ Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the $L{\small ORD}$ God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage _that_ reacheth up unto heaven. ^9

10 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: _but_ _are_ _there_ not with you, even with you, sins against the $L{\small ORD}$ your God? ^10

11 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the $L{\small ORD}$ _is_ upon you. ^11

12 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, ^12

13 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the $L{\small ORD}$ _already_, ye intend to add _more_ to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and _there_ _is_ fierce wrath against Israel. ^13

14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. ^14

15 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria. ^15

16 ¶ At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. ^16

17 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. ^17

18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there. ^18

19 For the $L{\small ORD}$ brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the $L{\small ORD}$. ^19

20 And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. ^20

21 For Ahaz took away a portion _out_ of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and _out_ of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave _it_ unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not. ^21

22 ¶ And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the $L{\small ORD}$: this _is_ _that_ king Ahaz. ^22

23 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, _therefore_ will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. ^23

24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the $L{\small ORD}$, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. ^24

25 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the $L{\small ORD}$ God of his fathers. ^25

26 ¶ Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they _are_ written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. ^26

27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, _even_ in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. ^27
