### 2 Chronicles 14

1 SO Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. ^1

2 And Asa did _that_ _which_ _was_ good and right in the eyes of the $L{\small ORD}$ his God: ^2

3 For he took away the altars of the strange _gods_, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: ^3

4 And commanded Judah to seek the $L{\small ORD}$ God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. ^4

5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. ^5

6 ¶ And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the $L{\small ORD}$ had given him rest. ^6

7 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about _them_ walls, and towers, gates, and bars, _while_ the land _is_ yet before us; because we have sought the $L{\small ORD}$ our God, we have sought _him_, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. ^7

8 And Asa had an army _of_ _men_ that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these _were_ mighty men of valour. ^8

9 ¶ And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. ^9

10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. ^10

11 And Asa cried unto the $L{\small ORD}$ his God, and said, $L{\small ORD}$, _it_ _is_ nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O $L{\small ORD}$ our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O $L{\small ORD}$, thou _art_ our God; let not man prevail against thee. ^11

12 So the $L{\small ORD}$ smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. ^12

13 And Asa and the people that _were_ with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the $L{\small ORD}$, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. ^13

14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the $L{\small ORD}$ came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. ^14

15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. ^15
