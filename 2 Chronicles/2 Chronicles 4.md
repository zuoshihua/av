### 2 Chronicles 4

1 MOREOVER he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof. ^1

2 ¶ Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. ^2

3 And under it _was_ the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen _were_ cast, when it was cast. ^3

4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea _was_ _set_ above upon them, and all their hinder parts _were_ inward. ^4

5 And the thickness of it _was_ an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; _and_ it received and held three thousand baths. ^5

6 ¶ He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea _was_ for the priests to wash in. ^6

7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set _them_ in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. ^7

8 He made also ten tables, and placed _them_ in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold. ^8

9 ¶ Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass. ^9

10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south. ^10

11 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God; ^11

12 _To_ _wit_, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters _which_ _were_ on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which _were_ on the top of the pillars; ^12

13 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which _were_ upon the pillars. ^13

14 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; ^14

15 One sea, and twelve oxen under it. ^15

16 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the $L{\small ORD}$ of bright brass. ^16

17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. ^17

18 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out. ^18

19 ¶ And Solomon made all the vessels that _were_ _for_ the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread _was_ _set;_ ^19

20 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; ^20

21 And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, _made_ _he_ _of_ gold, _and_ that perfect gold; ^21

22 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, _of_ pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy _place_, and the doors of the house of the temple, _were_ _of_ gold. ^22
